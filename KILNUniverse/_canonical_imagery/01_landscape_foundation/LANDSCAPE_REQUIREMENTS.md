## üó∫Ô∏è GEOGRAPHICAL RELATIONSHIPS

### **SPATIAL LAYOUT:**
1. **Central Kiln Complex** - Geographic and political center
2. **Weeping Mountains** - Eastern region, visible from Kiln
3. **Natural Clay Quarries** - Western region, maximum distance from Kiln
4. **Fired Plains** - Northern and southern regions, demonstration zones
5. **Tideforge Estuary** - Emerges southeastern, connecting mountains to ocean

### **TRAVEL RELATIONSHIPS:**
