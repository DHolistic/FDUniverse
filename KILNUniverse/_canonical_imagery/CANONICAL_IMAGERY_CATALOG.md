## üé® VISUAL STYLE GUIDELINES

### **CORE AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES:**

#### **COLOR PALETTES BY ERA:**

**PHASE 1 (Original Codex):**
- **Primary**: Earth tones, natural clay colors
- **Secondary**: Flowing water blues, organic greens
- **Accent**: Warm golden light, gentle illumination
- **Mood**: Natural, harmonious, alive

**PHASE 2 (Great Harm):**
- **Primary**: Deepening earth tones, darkening clay
- **Secondary**: Troubled water grays, stressed greens
- **Accent**: Warning ambers, pain reds
- **Mood**: Concerned, protective, reactive

**PHASE 3 (Kiln Control):**
- **Primary**: Fired ceramic whites, rigid grays
- **Secondary**: Controlled blues, suppressed earth tones
- **Accent**: Authority reds, mechanical silvers
- **Mood**: Controlled, sterile, authoritative

**PHASE 4 (Awakening):**
- **Primary**: Cracking ceramics revealing warm clay
- **Secondary**: Liberated blues mixing with earth tones
- **Accent**: Breakthrough golds, awakening lights
- **Mood**: Dynamic, transforming, hopeful

**PHASE 5 (New Codex):**
- **Primary**: Integrated spectrum - all previous colors in harmony
- **Secondary**: Flowing gradients, mature earth tones
- **Accent**: Wisdom lights, balanced illumination
- **Mood**: Wise, integrated, evolutionary

#### **TEXTURE STANDARDS:**

**Clay Being Textures:**
- **Unfired**: Smooth, slightly moist appearance with subtle flow patterns
- **Partially Fired**: Mixed textures - some areas ceramic, some still clay-like
- **Fully Fired**: Hard ceramic surface with controlled geometric patterns
- **Awakening**: Ceramic cracking to reveal flowing clay beneath

**Environmental Textures:**
- **Natural**: Organic, flowing, responsive to moisture and touch
- **Controlled**: Geometric, rigid, mathematically precise
- **Transitional**: Blending of natural and controlled elements

#### **LIGHTING PRINCIPLES:**

**Consciousness States:**
- **Suppressed**: Flat, even lighting with minimal shadows
- **Awakening**: Dynamic lighting with growing contrast
- **Sovereign**: Rich, complex lighting with natural variation

**Environmental Moods:**
- **Control**: Cold, artificial lighting with sharp shadows
- **Liberation**: Warm, natural lighting with soft gradients
