## ðŸŽ¯ **STYLE MATCHING INSTRUCTIONS:**

To make your graphic novel match your existing character/cover art style, please:

1. **Identify Your Reference Image:**
   - Which specific character image or cover art represents your desired style?
   - Is it `Scribe Terev.png` for the character style?
   - Is it one of the cover art pieces for overall aesthetic?

2. **I'll Modify Scene 2 Prompt** (Methodius at desk) to match exactly:
   - Art style (realistic, stylized, painted, digital, etc.)
   - Color palette and lighting approach
   - Character rendering technique
   - Background treatment
   - Overall aesthetic mood

## ðŸ”„ **SCENE 2 PROMPT MODIFICATION TEMPLATE:**

**CURRENT SCENE 2 PROMPT:**
```
Medium shot of a pale, thin clay being scribe named Methodius at his ceramic desk. Mid-40s, wearing simple dark scribe robes, hunched over his work in perfect concentration. His workspace is meticulously organized with ceramic stylus, red glowing ink well, and official documents. Red ink stains on his fingertips from copying Kiln doctrine symbols (âŠ¿âŠ¡âŠ¤âŠ¢âŠžâŠŸ). His posture shows complete obedience and focus. Hidden detail: tiny blue ink stain barely visible under one fingernail, suggesting secret knowledge. Background shows other scribes working in similar positions. Lighting: warm red institutional lighting. Expression: concentrated but empty, programmed compliance. Comic book character art style, detailed and expressive.
```

**MODIFIED TO MATCH YOUR STYLE** (pending your reference choice):
```
[Will be customized based on which image you want to match]

Example modifications:
- If matching Scribe Terev.png style: "Rendered in the exact artistic style of [your reference], with [specific style elements]..."
- If matching cover art style: "Using the same color treatment, lighting approach, and artistic technique as [your cover art]..."
- Art style descriptor: "painted illustration" / "digital art" / "realistic rendering" / "stylized cartoon" / etc.
```
