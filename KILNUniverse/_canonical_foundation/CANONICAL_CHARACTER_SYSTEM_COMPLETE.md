3. **WILLING COMPLIANCE** (Enforcer): Some choose to embrace control
4. **AUTHORITY INTEGRATION** (Scribe Terev, Oracle): Working within the system
5. **FORCED REFORM** (The Recycled): Consequence of resistance
6. **BREAKING POINT** (Ruin): When the system cracks
7. **VISION AWAKENING** (Glazed Eye Seer): Seeing beyond illusions
8. **ACTIVE RESISTANCE** (Salter-Singer): Fighting for freedom

### **READER INTEGRATION:**
