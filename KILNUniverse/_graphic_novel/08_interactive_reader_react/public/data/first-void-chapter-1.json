        "But the motion carried. Consciousness had its first recorded vote.",
        "From this moment forward, nothing would be the same. The clay that was becoming Aude had crossed an invisible threshold. It was no longer merely matter arranged in interesting patterns.",
        "It was aware. It was questioning. It was, in the most fundamental sense, alive."
