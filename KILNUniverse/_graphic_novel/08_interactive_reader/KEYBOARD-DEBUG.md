## üß™ How to Test & Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open `horizontal-reader.html` in browser
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Click **Console** tab
4. Keep this open while testing

### Step 2: Test Arrow Keys
Press arrow keys and watch console messages:

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Scroll wrapper focused for keyboard navigation
Wrapper re-focused after loading panels
Document keydown: ArrowRight
Global handler - navigating with: ArrowRight
handleKeyboard called with: ArrowRight Current panel: 0 Total: 15
Scrolling to next panel: 1
scrollToPanel called: 1 of 15
Scrolling to position: 1920 (panel width: 1920)
```

### Step 3: What to Look For

‚úÖ **If You See These Messages:**
- "Scroll wrapper focused for keyboard navigation" ‚úì
- "Document keydown: ArrowRight" when you press ‚Üí ‚úì
- "scrollToPanel called..." ‚úì
- Panel scrolls smoothly ‚úì

**‚Üí Everything is working!**

‚ùå **If You DON'T See Messages:**

**Problem 1: No "keydown" messages at all**
- Your browser might be blocking the events
- Try clicking on the page first, then press arrows
- Make sure you're not focused on browser address bar

**Problem 2: See "keydown" but panel doesn't scroll**
- Check if `scrollToPanel` is being called
- Look for error messages in red
- Panel width might be 0 (page not fully loaded)

**Problem 3: "Scroll wrapper not found!" error**
- Page didn't load properly
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5)

## üîß Troubleshooting Steps

### If keyboard still doesn't work:

**1. Click anywhere on the page**
Sometimes the scroll wrapper loses focus. Click on the page, then try arrows.

**2. Check current chapter**
```
Console should show:
"Scroll wrapper focused for keyboard navigation"
```
If you don't see this, the wrapper didn't get focus.

**3. Manual focus test**
Open console and type:
```javascript
document.getElementById('chapterScrollWrapper').focus()
```
Press Enter, then try arrow keys.

**4. Check if wrapper is scrollable**
Type in console:
```javascript
document.getElementById('chapterScrollWrapper').scrollLeft
```
Should return a number (usually 0). If error, wrapper doesn't exist.

## üéØ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Force Focus
If arrows don't work, **click on the main content area**, then try again.

### Fix 2: Reload Page
Press **Ctrl+R** or **F5** to reload.

### Fix 3: Test Different Chapter
Try Chapter 1 first (hint visible), then Chapter 2 (no hint).
