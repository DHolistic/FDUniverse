Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre describing the back cover of your ‚ÄúConsciousness Tablet‚Äù graphic novel concept: the Authority Side, visually and thematically mirroring the front.

Here‚Äôs a clean, production-ready prompt version that matches your front cover‚Äôs aesthetic precisely for DALL¬∑E (or any concept artist / art generator):

üúè BACK COVER ‚Äî AUTHORITY SIDE (Version D: Hands Emerging)

Prompt (for image generation):

A massive, ancient stone tablet, matching the front cover of the Consciousness Tablet exactly in shape, scale, and lighting ‚Äî but now showing the Authority Side. The tablet has a dark, weathered ceramic-stone surface covered in deep cracks and battle scars, evoking immense age and power.

RUNIC CERAMIC HANDS emerge from or hold the tablet‚Äôs edges ‚Äî the same partially fused, armored, and cracked hands from the front cover. They appear to be part of the tablet itself, made of ancient ceramic armor, with chips, soot, and fracture lines, as if forged in battle and time.

Central composition: glowing red KILN GLYPHS (‚äø‚ä°‚ä§‚ä¢‚äû‚äü) carved deep into the center. The glyphs burn with molten red light like liquid metal ‚Äî the phrase ‚Äú‚äø‚ä°‚ä§ ‚ä¢‚äû‚äü‚Äù (KILN RULE OF LAW) gleaming with oppressive heat. The grooves leak faint streams of ember and molten glow, cracks radiating out in geometric precision.

Atmosphere and lighting: same dramatic single-source illumination as the front ‚Äî deep chiaroscuro shadows envelop the edges. The red glyphs cast reflections on the cracked stone surface and faintly illuminate the hands with fiery authority light. The surrounding air ripples with heat shimmer; faint embers rise, leaving traces of smoke.

The mood is heavy, oppressive, and dangerous ‚Äî authority‚Äôs rigid answer to the front cover‚Äôs blue freedom. The stone feels like it‚Äôs alive, judging, radiating the weight of cosmic law.

The composition should evoke graphic novel cover realism, mature tone, and mythic gravitas ‚Äî a perfect counterpart to the Consciousness Tablet‚Äôs liberation side, now replaced with absolute control and order.

Color palette:

Deep shadows and blacks (#000000, #1A1A1A)

Authority red burns (#8B1538, #CC2222)

Weathered stone and ceramic earth tones (#4A4A4A, #8B7355)

Subtle warm highlights, no additional colors

Visual style: hyperrealistic, dark fantasy realism ‚Äî heavy texture detail, cinematic lighting, mythic atmosphere, professional graphic novel quality.

Would you like me to generate two visual drafts of this Authority back cover (in the same format and lighting as the front cover image you showed)?

Made with the old version of image generation. Learn more

Here are two visual drafts of the Authority Back Cover ‚Äî each interpreting the same oppressive, red-burning aesthetic in slightly different compositions and rune structures.

Would you like me to refine one of these versions (for example, adjust glyph clarity, lighting symmetry, or hand positioning) to more precisely match your front cover‚Äôs layout?

You said:
the second image please and can you do the same for the front 
DALL¬∑E said:
Made with the old version of image generation. Learn more

Here are two visual drafts for the front Consciousness Cover, designed to mirror the second Authority image ‚Äî same stone, same lighting balance, but glowing with the liberated blue energy.

Would you like me to align the composition framing and rune placement precisely between the two so they form a seamless front-and-back tablet pair?

You said:
with the images highlighted can you create a landscape image and the spine (being the title of the prequel - the codex so it the neutralization of the worlds the balnance) in upright down text english 
DALL¬∑E said:

Perfect ‚Äî so you want a landscape composition that unites the two tablet faces into a full wrap-around book cover, with:

Left side: the Consciousness (blue) tablet (front cover)

Right side: the Authority (red) tablet (back cover)

Center spine: neutral balance zone titled ‚ÄúTHE CODEX‚Äù (the prequel title), written vertically upright (top-to-bottom) in English, visually symbolizing balance / neutralization of worlds

The overall design will feel like one massive dual-sided relic ‚Äî half glowing blue liberation, half burning red authority ‚Äî fused by a centered neutral band of stone bearing the title.

üé® Prompt for Landscape Wraparound Cover

Create a landscape, wrap-around book cover composition showing both sides of the ancient Consciousness Tablet unified into one massive stone slab.

On the left half, show the Consciousness Side ‚Äî the same weathered ceramic-stone surface glowing with blue energy from deep glyphs and cracks. Blue runes pulse with radiant light representing freedom, awareness, and the mind‚Äôs awakening. Mist and light vapor rise softly from the surface.

On the right half, show the Authority Side ‚Äî the same battle-worn ceramic-stone surface but glowing with molten red glyphs burning like liquid metal. Cracks leak red ember light, smoke and heat shimmer rise. The atmosphere feels heavy and oppressive.

Between them, create a vertical stone spine section ‚Äî a narrow central band of neutral stone that transitions from blue to red, forming perfect equilibrium. Carved vertically (upright, top-to-bottom) into the spine in glowing white-silver light, write the title:

THE CODEX

The spine should symbolize balance and neutralization, glowing faintly white, with energy blending between both sides.

Lighting should be cinematic and dramatic, as if both forces meet and stabilize in the middle. The entire piece should look like an artifact of cosmic law and consciousness.

Color palette:

Deep shadows (#000000, #1A1A1A)

Radiant blue energy (#3AB6FF, #4ED1FF)

Molten red authority light (#8B1538, #CC2222)

Weathered stone (#4A4A4A, #8B7355)

Neutral white-silver energy (#D9D9D9) for the spine lettering

Style: hyperrealistic, cinematic, heavy stone texture, graphic novel cover quality, mythic duality, left = liberation, right = control, center = balance.

Would you like me to generate this wrap-around design now (in wide 1792√ó1024 format)?

Made with the old version of image generation. Learn more

I was able to produce one of the requested landscape wrap-around cover images successfully, but there were some issues that prevented generating the second version.

You can still see the completed image above ‚Äî it captures the left-side blue Consciousness Tablet, the right-side red Authority Tablet, and the balanced spine concept in the center.

If you‚Äôd like, I can now:

Fix the generation issues and produce the second alternate version, or

Refine this version ‚Äî for example, adjust the spine lettering (‚ÄúTHE CODEX‚Äù), make it more vertically aligned and glowing white, or rebalance the color and light symmetry.
