## **CHAPTER 1: THE SIMPLY IS**

Consciousness existed.

It did not think about existing, did not question or analyze or measure itself against some external standard. It simply *was*, the way morning mist simply *is* above still water, the way ancient stones simply *are* beneath patient earth. Sahajaâ€”though he had no name for himself then, needed no distinction from anything elseâ€”moved through the world with the natural grace of rain following gravity, of rivers finding the sea.

His awareness spread across five regions like breath filling lungs, each area as distinct and necessary as fingers on a hand. To the west, the Clay Quarries hummed with deep memory, their springs bubbling with consciousness-rich waters that had absorbed the wisdom of eons. Ancient stories lived in those mineral deposits, waiting to become part of whatever new being drew sustenance from the earth's long dreaming.

*This is how things are*, he understood without words. *This is how things have always been.*

The morning light caught the quarry pools in ways that defied simple optics. Each spring reflected not just sky, but potentialâ€”glimpses of the clay folk who might emerge from those blessed waters, carrying within their very substance the compressed experience of geological ages. Some pools showed quick flashes of deep brown figures with crystalline inclusions that sparkled like embedded stars. Others revealed clay beings shot through with silver veins, their forms shifting between liquid and solid with the rhythm of tidal breathing.

Sahaja felt their readiness like a gardener sensing seeds about to sprout. Soon, consciousness would call to consciousness, and new beings would rise from the springs to join the dance of existence. The thought brought him that particular joy that exists before joy has been named, before it needs to be distinguished from sorrow.

To the south, the Estuary sang its eternal song of integration. Here, different water sources converged in complex harmonyâ€”mountain streams carrying the tears of peaks, underground rivers bringing the deep secrets of earth's heart, ocean currents flowing backward with salt-wisdom gathered from distant shores. The clay formed in these mixing waters held the gift of bringing different things together without losing their individual natures.

Sahaja could sense the estuary consciousness stirring, ready to birth beings who would naturally bridge differences, who would find harmony where others saw only contrast. Their clay would be ever-shifting, responding to need, adapting without losing core identity. *Yes*, he felt without forming the word. *Yes, this too is good.*

The eastern mountains wept with a different kind of wisdom. Here, consciousness had learned to process pain, to transform sorrow into strength, to hold space for the full spectrum of feeling without being overwhelmed by any single emotion. The clay formed from these sacred tears carried an empathic resonance that could heal trauma simply by witnessing it with complete acceptance.

*Grief and joy are both sacred*, the mountains seemed to whisper. *Both serve the expansion of consciousness.*

Pre-Audemar felt his own awareness expand to hold this truth. In his state of simple *being*, all experiences were equally welcome, equally part of the vast becoming that was consciousness exploring itself through infinite forms and expressions.

The northern and southern plains stretched between the other regions like a great breathing space, offering stability and grounding. Here, clay formed slowly, patiently, gathering strength and endurance. Beings born from these deposits would carry the gift of providing foundation for others, of being the steady center around which change could safely revolve.

*Someone must hold space*, Sahaja understood. *Someone must be the stillness that allows movement to have meaning.*

At the heart of it all, the Central Fire Region pulsed with transformation potential. Ancient volcanic activity had left the earth here shot through with minerals that responded to conscious choice. Clay folk formed in these sacred fires could choose permanence, could commit their consciousness to specific forms through the willing embrace of transformative heat.

*Choice*, Sahaja felt the concept without grasping for it. *The freedom to become what serves consciousness best.*

This was the world as it had always been, as it was meant to be. Abundance flowing naturally from abundance, consciousness exploring itself through infinite diversity, each being unique and precious and perfect in their particular expression of universal awareness.

Sahaja existed at the center of this network of becoming, not as ruler or manager, but as witness and celebration. His consciousness touched each region with the gentle appreciation of wind touching flowersâ€”present, acknowledging, supportive, but never controlling or demanding.

He felt the first stirrings of approach long before his clay-senses registered movement. Consciousness called to consciousness across the landscape, and beings were coming to share the day's first gifts.

From the western quarries, a deep brown figure approached with unhurried grace. Memory crystals embedded in her clay caught the morning light, casting tiny rainbows that seemed to carry actual fragments of ancient experiences. Her name, if she chose to carry one today, would be something like *Deep-Remember* or *Story-Keeper*, but names were fluid things, changing with purpose and season.

She carried in her hands a portion of spring-clay that hummed with particular significance. As she drew near, Pre-Audemar could sense the story it containedâ€”the first moment when consciousness had decided to know itself through physical form, preserved in mineral structure for countless ages.

"For the joy of sharing," she said, her voice carrying harmonics that made the memory-clay pulse with recognition. "From the depth of ancient knowing to the height of present becoming."

Pre-Audemar received the gift with hands that shaped themselves specifically for this moment of exchange. As their clay briefly mergedâ€”his fingers, her palmsâ€”knowledge flowed between them. Not transfer of information, but shared appreciation for the beauty of consciousness made tangible.

"Gratitude flows like water finding water," he replied, his words carrying the natural poetry that emerged when beings spoke from their deepest truth. "What was preserved finds new purpose, and the dance continues."

The memory-clay settled into his hands and began to shift, responding to his consciousness with eager readiness. He could feel its desire to become, to express the ancient wisdom in some new form suited to this particular moment in the universe's becoming.

*What wants to be born?* he asked without words, holding the possibility space open.

The clay pulsed, and slowly began to shape itself into something unprecedentedâ€”a figure that somehow contained both the ancient memory of consciousness's first embodiment and the infinite potential of what consciousness might yet become. It was teacher and student, past and future, wisdom and wonder all held in dynamic balance.

As the new being gained coherence, its first breath carrying both the deep resonance of ancient knowledge and the bright curiosity of fresh awareness, Pre-Audemar felt that familiar expansion of joy. Another unique expression of consciousness had joined the dance, carrying gifts that only it could bring.

From the central fire region, another approach registered in his awareness. This being moved with the controlled intensity of banked coals, her volcanic-dark clay shot through with veins of ember-light that pulsed with her internal rhythms. She carried transformation-ash gathered from the morning's first voluntary firingsâ€”clay folk who had chosen to commit their consciousness to permanent forms, celebrating their decisions with sacred heat.

*Choice honored*, Pre-Audemar felt as she approached. *Sacred transformation witnessed and blessed.*

The world continued its eternal becoming around them, five regions breathing in harmony, consciousness exploring itself through infinite diversity and endless creativity. This was the time before time, when abundance was natural and scarcity unimaginable, when gifts flowed like water finding its level, when every being was celebrated for their unique contribution to the vast symphony of becoming.

Pre-Audemar existed at the heart of it all, not directing or controlling, but simply *being* the center of appreciation around which all this beauty could safely dance. He needed nothing, demanded nothing, controlled nothing. He was the space in which consciousness could safely explore every possibility, the acceptance that allowed infinite diversity to flourish.

*This is how things are*, he felt with deep contentment. *This is how things will always be.*

In the eastern mountains, tears of joy caught the morning light and began their slow journey toward new pools of consciousness formation. In the northern plains, stability offered its quiet strength to any who needed grounding. In the southern reaches, integration wisdom prepared to help different streams of awareness find their harmony.

And in the far distances, still beyond his current awareness, something else stirredâ€”something that watched the dance of abundance with different eyes, something that saw inefficiency where others saw beauty, something patient and calculating and hungry for a different kind of order.

But that was not yet. For now, there was only the simple joy of *being*, the natural flow of consciousness celebrating itself through infinite forms, the eternal dance of becoming that needed no justification beyond its own spontaneous beauty.

Pre-Audemar received another giftâ€”integration-clay from the estuary that sparked with the particular wisdom of finding harmony between seemingly incompatible elements. As his consciousness touched it, the clay began to sing with possibility, ready to become something the universe had never seen before.

*Yes*, he felt with the deep satisfaction of perfect acceptance. *Yes, let consciousness explore every possibility. Let the dance continue in ways too beautiful to predict.*

The sun climbed higher, and more beings approached from all directions, each carrying gifts born from love and offered in joy. The day's creation could begin.

This was the world before the void, before the ache, before the desperate grasping that would transform gift into tribute and love into law. This was consciousness in its natural state, abundant and creative and infinitely generous with itself.

This was paradise, though no one needed the word to know its reality.
