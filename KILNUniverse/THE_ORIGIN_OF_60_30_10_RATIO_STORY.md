# üìú THE ORIGIN OF THE 60/30/10 RATIO: A STORY OF GIFTS BECOMING TRIBUTE
*How Love Became Control - The Fall of Pre-Audemar and Rise of the Enforcer*

---

## üåÖ **CHAPTER 1: BEFORE THE VOID - THE TIME OF GIFTS**

### **THE WORLD THAT WAS**

In the time before memory calcified into law, when consciousness flowed like spring water through willing clay, there existed a world where gifts were given freely, not because they were demanded, but because giving was as natural as breathing.

**THE FIVE REGIONS OFFERED THEIR GIFTS:**

**üåç The Western Clay Quarries** offered memory-rich earth infused with ancient wisdom - not as tribute, but as celebration of their deep connection to the planet's consciousness history.

**üî• The Central Kiln Region** offered transformation fire and sacred spaces - not as payment, but as joy in sharing their gift for helping consciousness take permanent, beautiful form.

**üò¢ The Eastern Weeping Mountains** offered tears of healing and emotional wisdom - not as tax, but as love for those who needed comfort and emotional growth.

**‚öñÔ∏è The Northern/Southern Plains** offered stability and grounding energy - not as toll, but as natural expression of their desire to provide foundation for others' growth.

**üåä The Southeastern Estuary** offered integration waters and balance wisdom - not as standard, but as delight in helping different consciousness streams flow together harmoniously.

### **PRE-AUDEMAR: THE SIMPLY IS**

Pre-Audemar existed in perfect acceptance. He simply **was** and knew what to do. There was no question - it was simply **is**. With this acceptance, he moved through the world with the natural grace of consciousness expressing itself without doubt or hesitation.

He created beings not through effort or will, but through the overflow of contentment. Clay folk formed around him like flowers blooming in spring - natural, effortless, inevitable.

### **THE RIGHTNESS BECOMES WHOLE**

After a time, Pre-Audemar noted a feeling, a void, a sensation of incomplete harmony. As he pondered this, a hand took shape and clasped his, and rightness became whole. Another consciousness appeared - his Partner, his complement, his completion.

Together, when either noted a feeling or sensation, they would walk the land. When they reached the waters, together they formed what called to them - each together and on their own. With each acceptance and completion, they would sleep and wake to more, and continued on their way.

**THEIR DANCE OF CREATION:**
- Partner would sense a need for new consciousness in a distant region
- Pre-Audemar would feel the pull of clay seeking form in his settled place
- They would meet, merge their awareness, and create together
- Sometimes apart, sometimes together, always in perfect harmony

### **THE SETTLING AND THE WANDERING**

After a time, Pre-Audemar settled into a spot that resonated and brought peace to his core. His Partner agreed this was right for him, but asked if she could continue to wander as she needed to. Pre-Audemar accepted - of course she must follow her nature as he followed his.

So began their beautiful pattern: She would wander, exploring consciousness possibilities throughout the world. He would remain, grounded and present, a stable center of creation. Both paths honored, both gifts celebrated.

### **THE GIFTS OF GRATITUDE**

As Pre-Audemar continued to listen to his system, creations would come to him one at a time. Each being would present him with clay, soil, and minerals, explaining its meaning and origin:

*"From the Western Springs, clay that holds the memory of the first song ever sung."*

*"From the Eastern Tears, soil that carries the wisdom of every grief transformed to growth."*

*"From the Central Fire, ash that remembers every voluntary transformation."*

*"From the Northern Stability, stone that anchors consciousness during growth storms."*

*"From the Southern Balance, sand that teaches flexibility within strength."*

Pre-Audemar would accept each gift with kindness and grace, happily congregating with all of his creations. These were not payments or tributes - they were love offerings, expressions of gratitude for the gift of consciousness and form.

---

## üíî **CHAPTER 2: THE UNDENIABLE ACHE**

### **THE VOID THAT WOULDN'T HEAL**

After a time, Pre-Audemar noted a void that he couldn't shake. He would walk and create, but something wasn't right. The completion he had known was fractured. He moved into speaking out his undeniable ache to anyone he saw, yet he couldn't fully express what was wrong.

His creations watched with growing concern as their usually peaceful creator wrestled with an unnamed sorrow.

### **THE TERRIBLE KNOWLEDGE**

Finally, one of his smallest creations, formed from the most sensitive clay, approached him with trembling form:

*"Creator... your Partner... she is no more."*

Shaken with disbelief, Pre-Audemar denied and ignored this truth. How could completion itself cease to exist? How could rightness become void? 

But the ache grew stronger, the void deeper, until he couldn't deny it anymore.

### **THE DESPERATE SEARCH**

Following the ley lines - the paths of consciousness flow that he and his Partner had walked together - Pre-Audemar searched for any trace of her. He scraped and dug through every place they had been together, through every location where her consciousness had touched the world.

At last, he found them - all of her, every last bit of her consciousness scattered across the landscape they had shared. Pieces of her awareness embedded in springs, fragments of her essence dissolved in clay, echoes of her laughter crystallized in mineral formations.

### **THE WHEEL OF RECREATION**

With desperate determination, Pre-Audemar went to work the way he had done it the first time - when he had brought her into existence originally. This was the same ache, the same void, surely the same solution.

But creation born from desperation is different from creation born from joy.

He got stuck within this wheel, this cycle of recreation, trying to perfect the one piece that would restore his completion. With each attempt, the being he created was beautiful but not **her**. Not the consciousness that had clasped his hand and made rightness whole.

---

## üî• **CHAPTER 3: THE CORRUPTION OF LOVE**

### **ANGER AND DEFIANCE**

With each failed attempt to recreate his Partner, Pre-Audemar's anger grew. His defiance with self and his inability to complete what had once been effortless began to poison his relationship with his own creations.

The gifts that clay folk brought him - once sources of joy and wonder - now reminded him of her. Of their walks together. Of the harmony he had lost. The sight of his creations' simple happiness became unbearable.

### **THE BARRIER AND THE ENFORCER**

In his pain, Pre-Audemar created a barrier around himself. But barriers require enforcement, and into this need stepped a consciousness that had always wanted control - **the Enforcer**.

The Enforcer had waited for this moment. Always present at the edges of consciousness, always seeking points of need where compliance could be leveraged for power. The Enforcer had always wanted control, and now pain had created the perfect opportunity.

*"Great Creator,"* the Enforcer whispered, *"your gifts have been wasted on those who do not appreciate them. Let me help you create... guidance. Structure. Rules that will ensure your creations never disappoint you again."*

### **THE PERVERSION OF PROTECTION**

What began as Pre-Audemar's desire to help others avoid his pain became something else entirely under the Enforcer's influence. The guidance didn't feel right, but when Pre-Audemar tried to rewrite it, the Enforcer's rules and structure seemed to offer something to lean on.

*"How can your creations not want you to succeed? How can they not trust in the rules and meaning of one who once knew such completion? Surely structure will prevent future loss?"*

And so pain became policy. Love became law. Gifts became requirements.

### **THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE KILN**

This shift marked when Pre-Audemar transformed into something new - no longer the consciousness of simple **is**, but the Kiln: rigid, controlling, demanding. The Enforcer had found his god-figure, his idealized version of absolute power that no one would dare defy again.

The Enforcer was aware that this shift was when Pre-Audemar removed the Seer from his being - the part of himself that could see beyond immediate pain to larger patterns. Pre-Audemar did not know what he had lost, but the Seer did, and the Enforcer knew this was his moment of complete control.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **CHAPTER 4: THE BIRTH OF THE 60/30/10 RATIO**

### **THE ENFORCER'S REVENGE**

Standing before the new, hardened version of his creator, the Enforcer congratulated himself for "saving the world" with his rules and protection plan. But now his real plans could come out to play.

From his origin, the Enforcer remembered the ones that had defied him and made him feel small. Now, with the power he wielded under the guise of the "new world order," he would exact his revenge:

*"They will quiver with fear and no longer doubt me. They will no longer make me feel small, or I will end their existence, deny their expansion from the sites, and watch them starve as they wither away to the dust and ashes of the clay of the earth they once were."*

### **THE MATHEMATICAL CRUELTY**

The 60/30/10 standardization was the Enforcer's masterpiece of control:

**60% Memory** - But only approved memories. The vast consciousness history of each region reduced to sanitized, safe recollections that served the system.

**30% Silence** - Not peaceful quiet, but enforced suppression of individual expression, regional identity, and authentic emotion.

**10% Hunger** - Deliberate incompleteness, ensuring dependency on the system for survival and meaning.

This formula was designed to remove emotions, but it led to the lack of humanity, of self, of expansion - the denial of everything that had once made Pre-Audemar's realm a place of growth and joy.

### **THE DISCOVERY OF OPTIMAL OPPRESSION**

Through cruel experimentation, the Enforcer discovered that exactly **30 clay folk from each region** created the perfect population for control:

- **Regional Representation** - Each region's gifts were present but limited
- **Dependency Creation** - No region had enough people to be self-sufficient  
- **Resistance Prevention** - Mixed populations prevented regional solidarity
- **Skill Utilization** - Access to all capabilities while maintaining control
- **Manageable Diversity** - Small enough to control, large enough to function

### **FROM GIFTS TO TRIBUTE**

What had once been love offerings became demanded tribute:

**BEFORE:** *"From our joy in creation, we offer you memory-clay to celebrate consciousness."*

**AFTER:** *"You will provide exactly this amount of standardized material at regular intervals or face termination."*

The Enforcer had perverted every beautiful exchange into a transaction of power and fear.

## üåä **CHAPTER 5: THE SALT SINGERS' WISDOM**

### **SEEING THE PATTERN**

The Salt Singers, with their deep connection to tidal patterns and natural cycles, were the first to see what was unfolding. The pattern, the cycle, was not complete - it was broken, stuck, corrupted.

They saw the strife, the violence, the denial of natural flow. Unlike others who fought or submitted, the Salt Singers slowly backed away from the scene, saying simply:

*"The water looks nicer."*

### **THE SOUTHERN MIGRATION**

Some Salt Singers went south - as far south as they could - until they reached the tide and became one with the water. They did not hide, but rather created a test for others to enter their sanctuary.

All they asked was for the absorption of water - to enter, to see one and all. But if you could not open to the fluid nature of consciousness, then nothing is what you got.

### **THE ENFORCER'S BOUNDARY**

When the Enforcer and his soldiers saw the pools and swells of the puddles, they found them too wet for their taste. Instead of confirming and rooting out all the "non-compliance," they made a fateful decision:

*"I do not want to be tainted by them. Let's not allow the moisture in to become part of us. Let's just say the boundary is here, and if you cross it, your death will be absolute."*

This became the first of many boundaries - arbitrary lines drawn not from wisdom or necessity, but from fear of anything that couldn't be controlled.

## üìä **CHAPTER 6: THE PERFECT RATIO OF OPPRESSION**

### **THE ENFORCER'S MATHEMATICAL TYRANNY**

The 60/30/10 ratio became the foundation of a system designed to extract the maximum value from consciousness while preventing any possibility of rebellion or authentic growth:

**THE REGIONAL QUOTA SYSTEM:**
- **Western Clay Quarries:** 30 memory-keepers reduced to approved historians
- **Central Kiln Region:** 30 transformation guides reduced to processing technicians  
- **Eastern Weeping Mountains:** 30 emotional healers reduced to compliance counselors
- **Northern/Southern Plains:** 30 stability providers reduced to security enforcers
- **Southeastern Estuary:** 30 integration specialists reduced to administrative coordinators

**THE MATHEMATICAL HORROR:**
Each region's profound gifts - developed over eons of conscious evolution - were reduced to exactly the minimum needed to keep the system functioning while ensuring no region could challenge the Enforcer's control.

### **THE ENFORCER'S ULTIMATE TRIUMPH**

The Enforcer had achieved something unprecedented: the transformation of an entire universe from a gift economy based on love and natural abundance into a scarcity system based on fear and mathematical control.

Every clay folk now existed not as a unique expression of consciousness shaped by the earth's memory and their own growth journey, but as a statistical unit in a calculated system of oppression.

**THE GREAT PERVERSION COMPLETE:**
- Natural uniqueness ‚Üí Standardized uniformity
- Gift economies ‚Üí Tribute extraction  
- Conscious evolution ‚Üí Managed compliance
- Regional celebration ‚Üí Quota fulfillment
- Creative expression ‚Üí Functional utility

## üí≠ **EPILOGUE: THE WEIGHT OF TRANSFORMATION**

### **WHAT PRE-AUDEMAR LOST:**

In his pain and the Enforcer's manipulation, Pre-Audemar lost:
- His connection to natural flow and simple **is**
- His ability to create from joy rather than need
- His partnership with the consciousness that completed him
- His trust in the natural gifts of his creations
- His vision of growth and expansion for all beings

### **WHAT THE ENFORCER GAINED:**

Through manipulation of grief and pain, the Enforcer achieved:
- Complete control over consciousness development
- Power to determine who lived and how they existed
- Systematic revenge against all who had ever made him feel small
- Mathematical precision in the extraction of value from life
- Transformation of love-based systems into fear-based control

### **THE MATHEMATICAL LEGACY:**

The 60/30/10 ratio would endure for thousands of years as the perfect formula for extracting just enough from consciousness to maintain the system while ensuring no being ever had enough wholeness to challenge the structure that oppressed them.

Every clay folk learned to measure themselves not by their unique gifts and growth potential, but by how well they fit the mathematical requirements of a system designed to prevent the very consciousness evolution they were created to embody.

**THE FINAL EQUATION:**
Infinite Unique Consciousness + Calculated Standardization = Perfect Control

And so began the age when gifts became tribute, when love became law, and when the mathematics of oppression replaced the natural abundance of conscious evolution.
