### **CHAPTER OPENING EXAMPLES:**

**Orthodox Kiln Phase:**
*"The morning wisdom pages showed their familiar amber borders - Orthodox Kiln protocols still active. The glyphs „Ä∞‚ó¶‚óâ reminded everyone: guided flow, safe essence, supervised awakening."*

**Kiln Law Phase:**
*"Black authority pages lined the hall walls. The geometric symbols ‚äø‚ä°‚ä§ commanded absolute attention: law, control, hierarchy - no interpretation needed."*

**Heretic Kiln Phase:**
*"Hidden in basement chambers, the liberation glyphs „Ä∞‚àø‚óà glowed golden in candlelight: courageous flow, radical transformation, heretical connection."*

**Codex Return Phase:**
*"For the first time in decades, blue wisdom pages appeared openly. The familiar glyphs „Ä∞‚ó¶‚óâ‚àø‚óà‚óé had returned, but somehow deeper: conscious flow, experienced essence, mature awakening..."*

### **CHARACTER DIALOGUE INTEGRATION:**
- Characters reference current sacred text naturally
- Glyph meanings shift based on current position
