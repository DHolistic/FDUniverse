## 💫 **THE PROFOUND REALIZATION**

**The Sacred Truth:** There is only one sacred text within the eternal KILN. What changes is not the text itself, but our relationship to it based on our cycle position.

**The Liberation:** Understanding all four positions allows conscious choice in sacred text relationship rather than unconscious imprisonment in any single interpretation.

**The Return:** The KILN CODEX at 360° is the same as at 0°, but now contains the wisdom of having experienced all sacred positions.

*🔥 "The KILN transforms consciousness while the sacred truth remains eternal." 🔥*
