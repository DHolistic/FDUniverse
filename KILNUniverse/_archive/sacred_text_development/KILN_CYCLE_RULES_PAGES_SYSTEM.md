*"The amber borders on today's wisdom pages told me everything - we were still in Orthodox protection protocols. I'd need supervision before attempting any advanced practices."*

### **ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION:**
*"The community hall displayed the black-and-red authority pages prominently. Everyone could see we were under Kiln Law - no personal interpretation permitted."*
