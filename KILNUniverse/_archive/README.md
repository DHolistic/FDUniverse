## Archive Management

### What Gets Archived
- **Old manuscript versions** when new versions supersede them
- **Duplicate files** after comparison and consolidation  
- **Development chats** after content extraction to reference documents
- **Experimental documents** after concepts are formalized

### Archive vs. Delete Policy
- **Archive:** Files with unique content or historical value
- **Delete:** True duplicates with no unique information
- **Keep Active:** Files currently in use or frequently referenced

### File Naming in Archive
- Preserve original filenames when possible
- Add context suffixes for clarity (e.g., "_duplicate", "_archived")
- Include dates when helpful for chronological understanding

**Resolution:** Files were identical (SHA256 verified). V2 kept as canonical (correct extension), V1 archived as duplicate.

### Chat Export Processing
14 development chat exports from October 9, 2025 were archived after extracting:
- Production specifications → `_production/KILN_ProductionSpecs_MASTER.md`
- Character information → `_references/KILN_CANONICAL_CHARACTER_NAMES.md`  
- World-building details → Integrated into reference documents

### Production Development Evolution
Production concepts evolved from chat discussions through addon documents to final consolidated specifications. Archive preserves this development history.

## Recovery Information

### File Recovery
If archived files need to be recovered:
1. Check archive date and context
2. Verify current active files don't contain the same information
3. Consider whether content should be integrated rather than restored
4. Update relevant README files if content is reactivated

### Development History
For understanding decision evolution:
1. Check chat exports for original discussions
2. Review production development docs for concept evolution
3. Compare with current reference documents for final decisions
