Provenance & notes
- Canonical references used: `_canonical_foundation/` files (e.g., `CANONICAL_KILN_UNIVERSE_FOUNDATION.md` and codex files) for tonal and timeline consistency.
- Pilot assets: `visual_design/animation_pilot/` contains demo HTML/CSS/JS and placeholder glyph SVG/Lottie assets created during the session.
- Patch strategy: to avoid large in-place edits failures, manuscript was inlined by staged writes and new-file creation.

Suggested next changelog actions
- Record any editorial passes or copyedits with author/time and short rationale.
- Record any canonical changes (names, timeline shifts) with references to `_canonical_foundation/` files.
- Log any external conversions (EPUB/PDF) including toolchain and template used.
# THE TRANSLATOR'S BURDEN — MANUSCRIPT_CHANGELOG

Summary of edits and canonical linkages (chronological):

- 2025-10-23: Chapters 1–12 prose drafts created from panel scripts and canonical cross-checks performed. Linking notes reference `_canonical_foundation/CANONICAL_KILN_UNIVERSE_FOUNDATION.md`, `_canonical_foundation/CANONICAL_KILN_CODEX_ORIGINAL.md`, and `_canonical_foundation/INTEGRATED_RESISTANCE_CONSCIOUSNESS_SYSTEM.md` where applicable.
- 2025-10-23: Chapter 13 expanded into two epilogue variants (A: "The Invitation", B: "The Seed"). Both epilogues embed subtle seed-items and include a hush-note referencing an imperfect maker's mark in Variant A.

Per-chapter highlights:
- Chapter 1: Methodius discovers the pre-Kiln tablet and begins translating (added atmosphere and internal conflict).
- Chapter 2: Deepened translation practice and Cordelia's introduction to the preservation network.
- Chapter 3: Inserted explicit timeline marker (Year 1,200 AF) and a distributed-activation note linking to canonical five-stream activation.
- Chapter 4: Seed-spreading tactics and network recruitment documented.
- Chapter 5: Purge and Cordelia's arrest described; canonical enforcement phases referenced.
- Chapter 6: Evolution of resistance techniques (pressure-writing, steganographic methods).
- Chapter 7: Authority's pivot to controlled awakenings and cognitive camouflage.
- Chapter 8: Underground emergence and portable tablets; alignment to preservation streams.
- Chapter 9: Inter-regional network growth and emissary protocols.
- Chapter 10: Foundation ceremony, sacred vessels, and First Crack prophecy.
- Chapter 11: Great Archive stewardship and design for discoverability.
- Chapter 12: Cultural embedding and the Eternal Echo.
- Chapter 13: Two epilogue variants created to seed Book 1 and suggest inciting artifacts.

Next actions recommended:
1) Confirm which Chapter 13 variant(s) to include in the final master manuscript (A, B, or both). If you want canonical Book 1 protagonist names and to assign seed-item ownership, provide up to three names and indicate which epilogue to update.
2) If you want a fully inlined master manuscript (all chapters combined into one large file), confirm and I will inline chapters into `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Master.md`.
3) Update `_graphic_novel/08_interactive_reader/chapter-data.json` to reference the chosen epilogue variant(s) and any associated assets.
