# COPYEDIT SUMMARY — THE TRANSLATOR'S BURDEN (light pass)

Scope: Light copyedit pass focusing on grammar, clarity, and pacing across the manuscript with special attention to the merged canonical epilogue. This summary lists notable suggestions; no bulk changes applied yet. Apply any subset on request.

High-level notes
- Voice consistency: The narrative generally maintains a consistent third-person limited perspective centered on Methodius. A few sections shift into slightly more omniscient commentary (e.g., describing network-wide events in sweeping terms). Consider flagging 3–5 passages for tighter focalization if you want an intimate, character-led tone throughout.
- Repetition: Some phrases and metaphors ("the translator's burden," "blue glyphs," "red glyphs") recur often by design; consider trimming a small number of reiterations in Chapters 3–6 to maintain forward momentum.
- Paragraph length & pacing: Chapters 1–4 use longer, descriptive paragraphs that set tone well but occasionally slow forward action. For better pacing during conflict (interrogations, purges), break some long paragraphs into shorter beats to quicken rhythm.

Grammar & clarity (examples)
- Hyphenation and em dashes: Manuscript uses both ASCII hyphens and long dashes inconsistently (e.g., "—" vs "-"). Recommend normalizing to the typographic em-dash (—) without surrounding spaces for final export.
- Quotation punctuation: Some internal quotes (single versus double) are inconsistent. Decide on a single style (I recommend double quotes for direct speech and single quotes for inner citations) and normalize.
- Parenthetical notes & timeline markers: The manuscript contains in-line timeline notes (e.g., "[TIMELINE NOTE — Year 1,200 AF]") which are useful for canonical referencing but may interrupt flow for general readers. Suggest moving technical timeline markers to endnotes or a canonical appendix if you plan a public-facing edition.

Style & worldbuilding clarity
- Glyph references: The manuscript uses glyph characters (〰 ◦ ◉) and descriptive phrases. For final export, I recommend adding a short appendix or inline glossary mapping these glyphs to consistent terms (e.g., "Flow glyph (〰) — teaching of attention"). This aids readers unfamiliar with symbolic notation.
- Canonical references: Linking notes reference `_canonical_foundation/` files. For distribution, either remove file-path references from the main text or convert them to endnotes so the narrative remains immersive.

Specific pacing suggestions
- Chapter 3 (Double Life): Consider trimming ~150–300 words from the interrogation and aftermath sections or split them with a scene break to sustain narrative forward motion.
- Chapter 5 (The Crackdown): Break a long paragraph describing the purge into 3–4 shorter paragraphs to increase urgency and make the consequences read more immediate.
- Chapters 10–12 (Foundation & Echo): These chapters are deliberately reflective. If you want to maintain tension toward Book 1, consider adding a short, concrete scene at the end of Chapter 12 that hints at the immediate next generation's first discovery.

Merged Epilogue (canonical)
- Tone: The merged epilogue reads as a calm, measured coda, which fits the archival voice. If you prefer a stronger bridge into Book 1, add a brief scene where Talen or another named apprentice experiences the first clear moment of curiosity (e.g., "Talen's thumb paused on the token; the rhythm took him by surprise").
- Clarity: The canonical epilogue references multiple seed items. Consider listing them explicitly (as a 1–3 bullet inline or appendix) so that interactive-reader metadata can map seeds to specific assets (e.g., kneading rhythm → audio file; token → SVG).

Actionable next steps (pick any)
- I can apply the mechanical normalizations (dashes, quotation marks) across the manuscript and produce a "cleaned" canonical master.
- I can implement the paragraph/pacing edits described above as optional revisions and show a before/after diff for your review.
- I can extract all inline canonical linking notes into a `CANONICAL_APPENDIX.md` and replace the in-text markers with simple footnote references.
- I can add a small appendix listing the seed items (with canonical IDs) to support interactive-reader mapping and animation assets.

If you tell me which of the actionable steps you'd like, I'll apply them and update the changelog. If you'd like, I can also run an automated pass (spellcheck + basic grammar) first and present the top 20 flagged suggestions for review.
