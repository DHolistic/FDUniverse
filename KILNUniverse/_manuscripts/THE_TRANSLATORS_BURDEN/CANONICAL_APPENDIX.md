# CANONICAL APPENDIX — Linking Notes & Timeline Markers

This appendix collects timeline markers, linking notes, and canonical references removed from inline manuscript text to keep the narrative clean for readers. Use these references for canonical verification, interactive-reader metadata, or scholarly notes.

Timeline anchors and notable references
- Year 1,200 AF — Catalyst window for Methodius's translations and the five-stream activation. (See `_canonical_foundation/CANONICAL_KILN_UNIVERSE_FOUNDATION.md`.)
- Five-stream activation mapping — Si‑Al Memory Keepers, Ti‑V Sacred Forge contacts, Zn‑Pb Boundary Keepers, Na‑Cl Salt‑Singer routes, Fragment Keepers. See `_canonical_foundation/INTEGRATED_RESISTANCE_CONSCIOUSNESS_SYSTEM.md` for full stream definitions.

Glyph & codex references
- Canonical glyph list: `CANONICAL_KILN_CODEX_ORIGINAL.md` (primary glyphs used in manuscript: 〰, ◦, ◉, ◈, ⬡, ∾, ⟐, ◊).
- Codex and foundation documents: see files under `_canonical_foundation/`.

Linking notes removed from the prose
- Chapters with explicit canonical linking notes were: 3 (Year 1,200 AF + five-stream note), 4 (five-stream activation alignment), 6 (post-purge adaptation), 9 (network activation), 10 (codex creation), 11 (archive design), 12 (echo development), and several chapters with glyph references.

How to use this appendix
1. For scholarly exports, include this appendix as endnotes or a separate canonical reference document.
2. For interactive-reader metadata, map `chapter-data-canonical.json` entries to corresponding canonical references here.
3. If you want the in-text markers restored to a footnote style, I can apply that transformation across the manuscript and replace inline markers with numeric footnotes.
