Notes:
- The full chapter texts are in `_manuscripts/THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN/chapters/` (each `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Chapter_X_Prose.md`).
- Chapter 13 epilogues are provided as `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Chapter_13_Epilogue_A.md` and `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Chapter_13_Epilogue_B.md`. Choose one to include in a final compiled manuscript, or include both as alternate endings.
- If you want me to inline every chapter into this single file, I can do that next (it will create a larger file). Confirm if you prefer an inlined master or a TOC plus references (current).

Changelog: See `MANUSCRIPT_CHANGELOG.md` for per-chapter notes.
