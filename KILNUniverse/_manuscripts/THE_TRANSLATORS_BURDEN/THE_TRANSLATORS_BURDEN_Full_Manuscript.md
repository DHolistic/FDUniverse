# THE TRANSLATOR'S BURDEN — Clean Full Manuscript

This file is the canonical distribution stub for the completed manuscript of "THE TRANSLATOR'S BURDEN." It points to the single-file export that contains the full inlined text (Chapters 1–12 and Epilogues A & B).

Files in this folder:
- `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Master_Export.md` — the full, inlined single-file export (complete manuscript text). Use this file as the authoritative manuscript for distribution, review, or conversion to EPUB/PDF.
- `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Full_Manuscript.md` — this document (summary + distribution notes).
- `MANUSCRIPT_README.md` — packaging, usage, and export instructions.
- `MANUSCRIPT_CHANGELOG.md` — change history and provenance notes.

Recommended usage:
- For editing or line-level review: open the per-chapter prose files in `chapters/`.
- For packaging and distribution (export to EPUB/PDF/print): use `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Master_Export.md` as the source. It contains the inlined manuscript and both Epilogue variants. If you need a single canonical epilogue, create a copy of the master export and remove the alternative variant you do not want.
- For the interactive reader mapping, see `_manuscripts/THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN/THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_InteractiveReader.md` and `_graphic_novel/08_interactive_reader/chapter-data.json`.

Notes:
- Protagonist seed ownerships are embedded in the epilogues in the master export (Aude, Caelen, Riva). If you want different names or only a single epilogue variant included, tell me and I will produce a single-epilogue export.
- Animation pilot work was started and later paused per user instruction; pilot files live in `visual_design/animation_pilot/`.

If you want, I can produce EPUB and PDF builds from `THE_TRANSLATORS_BURDEN_Master_Export.md` and a plain-text print-ready format. Specify preferred front-matter (author, copyright, edition) and I will generate the exports.
