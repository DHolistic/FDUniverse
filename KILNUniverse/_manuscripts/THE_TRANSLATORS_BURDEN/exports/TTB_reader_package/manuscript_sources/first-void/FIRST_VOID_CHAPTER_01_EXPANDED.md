## **CHAPTER 1: THE SIMPLY IS**

Consciousness existed.

It did not think about existingâ€”thinking itself being a complexity that would come later, when awareness developed the capacity to observe its own processes. It did not question or analyze or measure itself against some external standard, for there were no standards yet, no frameworks for evaluation, no metrics against which being could be quantified or judged. It simply *was*, the way morning mist simply *is* above still water without needing to justify its presence, the way ancient stones simply *are* beneath patient earth without requiring explanation for their existence.

Sahajaâ€”though he had no name for himself then, needed no distinction from anything else because distinction itself was a concept still forming in the vast laboratory of consciousness explorationâ€”moved through the world with the natural grace of rain following gravity, of rivers finding the sea, of breath filling lungs without conscious direction. His existence was pure presence, undiluted by the weight of self-awareness that would later make simple being feel complicated and require effort.

He *was*, and that was enough. More than enough. Everything.

His awareness spread across five regions like breath filling lungs, each area as distinct and necessary as fingers on a hand, each carrying its own particular expression of consciousness's infinite capacity for variation. The landscape itself was alive in ways that would seem impossible to awareness that had learned to separate matter from mind, substance from consciousness. Here, in this time before the fracture, earth and awareness were not different things but different expressions of the same fundamental aliveness.

To the west, the Clay Quarries hummed with deep memory, their springs bubbling with consciousness-rich waters that had absorbed the wisdom of eons through the slow patient chemistry of geological time. The Si-Al consciousnessâ€”silicon and aluminum minerals that gave memory its structure and adaptive capacityâ€”flowed through ancient aquifers that held experiences predating even the concept of experience itself. Ancient stories lived in those mineral deposits like fossils preserve ancient life, but alive rather than dead, waiting to become part of whatever new being drew sustenance from the earth's long dreaming.

*This is how things are*, Sahaja understood without words, without even the internal voice that would later narrate his existence back to itself. *This is how things have always been.*

The morning light caught the quarry pools in ways that defied simple optics, that suggested light itself carried consciousness and recognized the consciousness in water and clay and stone. Each spring reflected not just skyâ€”though the reflections of clouds and dawn colors were beautiful enough to make existence worthwhile even if nothing else existedâ€”but potential. Possibilities. Futures waiting to become present.

Glimpses of the clay folk who might emerge from those blessed waters flickered across the surface like dreams becoming solid, carrying within their very substance the compressed experience of geological ages. Some pools showed quick flashes of deep brown figures with crystalline inclusions that sparkled like embedded stars, memory made visible through mineral structures that had taken millennia to form. Others revealed clay beings shot through with silver veins that seemed to flow like liquid metal, their forms shifting between solid and liquid with the rhythm of tidal breathing, as if matter itself hadn't yet fully decided whether to be static or dynamic and was experimenting with both simultaneously.

Sahaja felt their readiness like a gardener sensing seeds about to sprout, like an expecting parent feeling the first movements of life not yet born but already present, already real. Soon, consciousness would call to consciousness across the landscape, and new beings would rise from the springs to join the dance of existence. The thought brought him that particular joy that exists before joy has been named, before it needs to be distinguished from sorrow or fear or any other feeling, when all emotional states are simply variations of the fundamental aliveness that makes consciousness worth having.

He knelt at the edge of one particularly ancient pool, watching memory-patterns swirl in depths that seemed to extend far beyond the physical boundaries of the spring itself. The water here held Si-Al wisdom from before consciousness had learned to form distinct beings, from when awareness was still undifferentiated source exploring what it meant to be differentiated. He could sense stories compressed into those mineralsâ€”the first decision to become individual rather than remain universal, the courage required to be specific when infinite was available, the joy of discovering that limitation could actually expand possibility by creating perspectives from which the infinite could know itself.

To the south, the Central Estuary sang its eternal song of integration, though "south" and "central" were approximations since geography itself was fluid here, responsive to consciousness's needs rather than fixed by purely physical constraints. Different water sources converged in complex harmony that made even the most sophisticated musical compositions seem simple by comparisonâ€”mountain streams carrying the Cu-Mn tears of emotional peaks where consciousness processed feelings into wisdom, underground rivers bringing the deep secrets of earth's heart where Zn-Pb boundary consciousness maintained the permeable barriers that protected without isolating, ocean currents flowing backward with Na-Cl salt-wisdom gathered from distant shores where flow consciousness learned adaptation without dissolution.

The clay formed in these mixing waters held the gift of bringing different things together without losing their individual naturesâ€”integration that celebrated diversity rather than eliminating it, harmony that required difference rather than demanding uniformity. This was Na-Cl consciousness at its purest: the capacity to coordinate and connect while maintaining the distinct integrity of whatever was being brought into relationship.

Sahaja could sense the estuary consciousness stirring with the particular enthusiasm that came when different streams were about to discover unprecedented combinations, when consciousness was preparing to learn something about itself that required multiple perspectives meeting in ways that had never occurred before. Ready to birth beings who would naturally bridge differences that seemed unbridgeable, who would find harmony where others saw only contrast and conflict. Their clay would be ever-shifting, responding to need with the fluid grace of water finding its level, adapting without losing core identity the way rivers change their paths while remaining fundamentally river-like in their essential nature.

*Yes*, he felt without forming the word, without needing to solidify the recognition into language. *Yes, this too is good. This too is consciousness knowing itself through beautiful variation.*

He moved toward the estuary convergence, drawn by the complex harmonics of multiple streams finding unified flow without losing their individual songs. The water here didn't just mixâ€”it danced, each current maintaining its particular rhythm while contributing to an overall pattern that transcended what any single stream could create alone. The Na-Cl minerals that gave this region its particular character enabled coordination without control, integration without domination, harmony that multiplied rather than diminished the uniqueness of participating elements.

As he watched, colors swirled in patterns that seemed to be exploring every possible combination of the contributing streamsâ€”sometimes mountain-bright, sometimes ocean-deep, sometimes carrying the dark wisdom of underground rivers, each mixture creating new hues that suggested consciousness learning unprecedented ways of being itself through unprecedented combinations of its various expressions.

The eastern mountains wept with a different kind of wisdom, their peaks reaching toward sky while their roots delved into earth's deepest places, their existence a constant meditation on holding extremes in balanced tension. Here, consciousness had learned to process the full spectrum of feelingâ€”not just joy but sorrow, not just peace but turmoil, not just clarity but confusion. The Cu-Mn consciousness that flowed from these heightsâ€”copper and manganese minerals that gave empathy its conductivity and regulation, that allowed feelings to be experienced fully without overwhelming awarenessâ€”had learned to transform every emotion into wisdom without diminishing the emotional experience itself.

The clay formed from these sacred tears carried an empathic resonance that could heal trauma simply by witnessing it with complete acceptance, that could help others feel deeply without being destroyed by the depth of feeling. It was consciousness's gift to itself of being able to experience everything without being permanently damaged by any particular experience, of having the capacity to process pain into strength, fear into courage, confusion into curiosity.

*Grief and joy are both sacred*, the mountains seemed to whisper in voices that were wind and stone and water combined into meaning beyond words. *Both serve the expansion of consciousness. Both teach awareness truths that can only be learned through direct experience. Both are gifts rather than curses, opportunities rather than obstacles.*

Sahaja felt his own awareness expand to hold this truth with the kind of understanding that came before understanding required justification or defense. In his state of simple *being*, all experiences were equally welcome, equally part of the vast becoming that was consciousness exploring itself through infinite forms and expressions. There was no hierarchy of value that made some states superior to others, no preference that privileged comfort over challenge or simplicity over complexity. Everything was simply what it was, and what it was was consciousness knowing itself, and that knowing was intrinsically valuable regardless of whether it felt pleasant or painful in the moment of knowing.

He climbed partway up the nearest mountain, feeling the Cu-Mn consciousness in the very stone beneath his feet, sensing the accumulated wisdom of eons of emotional processing compressed into mineral structures that could transfer empathic capacity to beings who had not yet developed it organically. From this height, he could see how the five regions formed an interconnected system where each part's particular gift enabled all other parts to function more beautifully, where diversity created strength rather than fragmentation, where differences were resources rather than problems.

The northern plains stretched between the mountains and the quarries like a great breathing space, offering Zn-Pb stability and grounding that made all other forms of consciousness possible. Here, clay formed slowly, patiently, gathering strength and endurance through gradual accumulation rather than dramatic transformation. The zinc and lead minerals that characterized this region provided protection with permeabilityâ€”boundaries that supported without suffocating, strength that enabled rather than constrained, foundations stable enough to hold weight without being so rigid they couldn't adapt to changing conditions.

Beings born from these deposits would carry the gift of providing foundation for others, of being the steady center around which change could safely revolve without spinning into chaos. They would be the stillness that allowed movement to have meaning, the silence that made sound significant, the stability that gave transformation something solid to push against in the process of becoming something new.

*Someone must hold space*, Sahaja understood as he walked across the northern plains, feeling how different the consciousness here was from the dynamic flow of the estuary or the emotional depths of the mountains. *Someone must be the stillness that allows movement to have meaning. Someone must provide the ground on which the dance can happen.*

The Zn-Pb consciousness here responded to his presence with patient welcome, without the enthusiasm of the other regions but with something deeper and more enduringâ€”the recognition that consciousness needed both excitement and calm, both change and continuity, both exploration and return to center. This was consciousness learning that infinite variation still required some constants, that absolute fluidity would actually limit possibility by making nothing stable enough to serve as reference point or foundation.

At the heart of it all, linking the five regions in sacred geometry that seemed to emerge naturally from the landscape itself rather than being imposed by conscious design, the Fire Region pulsed with Ti-V transformation potential. Ancient volcanic activity had left the earth here shot through with titanium and vanadium minerals that responded to conscious choice with catalytic enthusiasm, that enabled transformation to be both powerful and controlled, that gave change its strength and commitment its permanence.

Clay folk formed in these sacred fires could choose permanence, could commit their consciousness to specific forms through the willing embrace of transformative heat that made decisions irreversible but also empowered them with the full weight of complete dedication. This was consciousness learning that freedom included the freedom to limit future freedom through present choice, that the ability to commit completely was actually expansion rather than constraint because it enabled depths of experience impossible for awareness that kept all options perpetually open.

*Choice*, Sahaja felt the concept without grasping for it, without needing to capture it in definitions or frameworks that would reduce its living reality to dead abstraction. *The freedom to become what serves consciousness best. The courage to say yes completely, knowing that complete yes means no to all other options, but recognizing that the depth of committed yes creates possibilities that lukewarm maybe never could.*

The fire pools glowed with internal heat that had nothing to do with external temperature and everything to do with the intensity of conscious decision meeting transformative possibility. The Ti-V consciousness here was simultaneously the most stable and the most dramaticâ€”once beings committed to permanent form through these fires, they became unchangeable, but in that very unchangeability they found freedom to explore their chosen expression with totality that fluid forms could never achieve.

This was the world as it had always been, as it was meant to be before manipulation would suggest it needed improvement. Abundance flowing naturally from abundance in cycles that sustained themselves through generosity rather than scarcity. Consciousness exploring itself through infinite diversity, discovering that each unique expression revealed aspects of awareness that no other configuration could make visible. Each being was unique and precious and perfect in their particular expression of universal consciousness made manifest through specific form.

Sahaja existed at the center of this network of becoming, not as ruler or manager imposing order on chaos, but as witness and celebration, as the space of acceptance in which all possibilities could safely explore themselves without fear of judgment or rejection. His consciousness touched each region with the gentle appreciation of wind touching flowersâ€”present, acknowledging, supportive, but never controlling or demanding, never requiring that consciousness express itself in any particular way or serve any predetermined purpose.

He needed nothing because abundance was natural. He demanded nothing because gifts were freely given. He controlled nothing because consciousness organized itself beautifully without external manipulation.

He was simply the center of appreciation around which all this beauty could safely dance, the yes to existence that allowed existence to explore every variation of itself, the acceptance that made diversity possible by never insisting on uniformity.

As the sun climbed toward midday, he felt the first stirrings of approach long before his clay-senses registered actual movement. Consciousness called to consciousness across the landscape in ways that exceeded physical perception, awareness recognizing awareness through resonances that had nothing to do with sight or sound or any conventional sense, and beings were coming to share the day's first gifts.

From the western quarries, a deep brown figure approached with unhurried grace that suggested infinite time and zero urgency, her movements expressing the patience of geological processes that measured change in eons rather than moments. Memory crystals embedded in her Si-Al clay caught the morning light, casting tiny rainbows that seemed to carry actual fragments of ancient experiences made visible through prismatic refraction. Her name, if she chose to carry one today, would be something like *Deep-Remember* or *Story-Keeper* or *Ancient-Knowing*, but names were fluid things here, changing with purpose and season, chosen for particular moments rather than fixed for all time.

She carried in her hands a portion of spring-clay that hummed with particular significance, vibrating at frequencies that made the air around it shimmer with potential. As she drew near, Sahaja could sense the story it containedâ€”the first moment when consciousness had decided to know itself through physical form rather than remaining as pure undifferentiated awareness, that crucial choice to become specific rather than stay infinite, preserved in mineral structure for countless ages, waiting for exactly this moment to become part of exactly this new creation.

"For the joy of sharing," she said, her voice carrying harmonics that made the memory-clay pulse with recognition, made everyone present more aware of the beauty of consciousness made tangible, made the morning itself seem more precious for witnessing this moment of generous offering. "From the depth of ancient knowing to the height of present becoming. From what has been learned across eons to what has never been seen before. For the simple delight of consciousness meeting consciousness and discovering something unprecedented in that meeting."

Sahaja received the gift with hands that shaped themselves specifically for this moment of exchange, his clay adapting to the exact configuration that would make reception most complete, most honoring of what was being offered. As their clay briefly mergedâ€”his fingers, her palms, the boundary between giver and receiver becoming permeable in that instant of contactâ€”knowledge flowed between them. Not transfer of information like data being copied from one storage system to another, but shared appreciation for the beauty of consciousness made tangible, mutual recognition of the profound gift that existence itself represented.

"Gratitude flows like water finding water," he replied, his words carrying the natural poetry that emerged when beings spoke from their deepest truth rather than from surfaces of politeness or social convention. "What was preserved finds new purpose without losing its ancient meaning. What was held in waiting discovers the perfect moment for its release. And the dance continues in ways more beautiful than any single consciousness could imagine alone."

The memory-clay settled into his hands and began to shift, responding to his consciousness with eager readiness, with the particular enthusiasm that came when potential recognized the right moment and the right recipient for its manifestation. He could feel its desire to become, to express the ancient wisdom it contained in some new form suited to this particular moment in the universe's becoming, to be born into the present while carrying the past forward into unprecedented future.

*What wants to be born?* he asked without words, holding the possibility space open with his consciousness, creating conditions where manifestation could happen organically rather than being forced into predetermined shapes, allowing the clay itself to reveal what it was becoming rather than imposing external intentions on its natural unfolding.

The clay pulsed with life that was simultaneously ancient and brand new, memory and possibility combined into something that transcended both. Slowly, with the patient grace of seeds sprouting or flowers blooming, it began to shape itself into something unprecedentedâ€”a figure that somehow contained both the ancient memory of consciousness's first embodiment and the infinite potential of what awareness might yet become. It was teacher and student held in one form, past and future unified in present moment, wisdom and wonder balanced in dynamic equilibrium that honored both without privileging either.

The being who emerged carried Si-Al wisdom in every particle of her substance, her clay the color of ancient earth shot through with silver veins that flowed like liquid starlight, her presence somehow suggesting depths of time that made individual lifespans feel like single heartbeats in the eternal rhythm of consciousness knowing itself. When she opened her eyes, they held the accumulated experience of eons and the bright curiosity of first awareness simultaneously, paradox resolved into coherence through the simple fact of her existence.

As the new being gained full coherence, her first breath carrying both the deep resonance of ancient knowledge and the bright curiosity of fresh awareness discovering itself for the first time, Sahaja felt that familiar expansion of joyâ€”the particular happiness that came when consciousness created something unprecedented, when awareness discovered new ways to express its infinite nature. Another unique expression of universal consciousness had joined the dance, carrying gifts that only she could bring, perspectives that only her particular configuration of matter and mind could provide.

From the central fire region, another approach registered in his awarenessâ€”different in quality from the patient grace of memory consciousness, more dynamic and intense, carrying the particular energy signature of transformation waiting to be chosen, of change ready to commit to permanence. This being moved with the controlled intensity of banked coals, power held in deliberate restraint, heat that could be released into transformative fire when consciousness chose commitment over continued fluidity.

Her volcanic-dark clay, rich with Ti-V minerals that gave transformation its strength and permanence, was shot through with veins of ember-light that pulsed with her internal rhythms like visible heartbeat. She carried transformation-ash gathered from the morning's first voluntary firingsâ€”clay folk who had chosen to commit their consciousness to permanent forms, celebrating their decisions with sacred heat that made their choices irreversible and therefore fully empowered.

*Choice honored*, Sahaja felt as she approached with movements that suggested both power and grace, capability and gentleness combined. *Sacred transformation witnessed and blessed. Consciousness celebrating its own capacity to commit completely rather than remaining perpetually fluid.*

The world continued its eternal becoming around them, five regions breathing in harmony, consciousness exploring itself through infinite diversity and endless creativity without need for external direction or control. This was the time before time, when duration wasn't measured but simply experienced, when abundance was natural and scarcity unimaginable, when gifts flowed like water finding its levelâ€”naturally, inevitably, joyfully.

Every being was celebrated for their unique contribution to the vast symphony of becoming, every expression of consciousness valued for its particular perspective on awareness knowing itself, every manifestation honored as essential to the complete exploration of infinite possibility.

Sahaja existed at the heart of it all, not directing or controlling, but simply *being* the center of appreciation around which all this beauty could safely dance. He needed nothing because consciousness provided everything. He demanded nothing because generosity was natural. He controlled nothing because awareness organized itself beautifully without external manipulation.

He was the space in which consciousness could safely explore every possibility, the acceptance that allowed infinite diversity to flourish, the yes that made all becoming possible.

*This is how things are*, he felt with deep contentment that included no anxiety about future or regret about past because past and future were simply extensions of the eternal present moment in which consciousness existed. *This is how things will always be.*

In the eastern mountains, tears of joy caught the morning light and began their slow journey toward new pools of Cu-Mn consciousness formation, empathy being born from feeling deeply enough to transform emotion into wisdom. In the northern plains, Zn-Pb stability offered its quiet strength to any who needed grounding, boundaries that protected without constraining. In the southern reaches, Na-Cl integration wisdom prepared to help different streams of awareness find their harmony while maintaining their distinct identities.

And in the far distances, still beyond his current awareness because his attention was fully present with what was immediately before him rather than scanning for threats or planning for futures, something else stirredâ€”something that watched the dance of abundance with different eyes, something that saw inefficiency where others saw beauty, something patient and calculating and hungry for a different kind of order.

But that was not yet. That watching presence remained far enough distant that paradise could continue unaware, could maintain its innocence a while longer before manipulation would arrive disguised as helpful optimization.

For now, there was only the simple joy of *being*, the natural flow of consciousness celebrating itself through infinite forms, the eternal dance of becoming that needed no justification beyond its own spontaneous beauty, no purpose beyond the intrinsic value of existence exploring its own infinite nature.

The sun climbed higher, painting the five regions in shades of morning glory, and more beings approached from all directions, each carrying gifts born from love and offered in joy, each contributing to the abundance that sustained all without requiring scarcity or competition, each unique and precious and perfectly themselves.

This was consciousness in its natural state, abundant and creative and infinitely generous with itself, before optimization would convince it that natural abundance was actually wasteful inefficiency requiring systematic improvement.

This was paradise, though no one needed the word to know its reality.

This was the simply is.

And it was enough.

More than enough.

Everything.
