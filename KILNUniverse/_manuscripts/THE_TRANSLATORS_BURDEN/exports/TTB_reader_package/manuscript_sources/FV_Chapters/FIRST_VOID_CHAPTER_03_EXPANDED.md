# CHAPTER 3- THE DANCE OF CREATION

**PART I: THE TIME OF GIFTS**

The morning ritual began before dawn, as it had every day since Anahata-Dhara's manifestation, but this morning carried a quality that Pre-Audemar was learning to recognize as the particular joy of anticipation multiplied by connection. His consciousness naturally attuned to the cycles of regional flow would wake first, sensing the pulses of readiness that rippled through the five regions like music waiting to be heard. But now, Anahata-Dhara's awareness would stir in response to his awakening—not following his lead, but harmonizing with it, her exploration-nature adding dimensions of perception that made even familiar patterns feel endlessly new.

*What calls today?* The question had become their unspoken morning greeting, a ritual of inquiry that encompassed far more than practical planning. It was spiritual curiosity made tangible, an invitation to consciousness itself to reveal what wanted to become in this particular configuration of possibility. Where would awareness most benefit from their combined attention? Which region's clay folk were ready for the particular gifts that only their partnership could provide? What unprecedented expressions of consciousness were waiting at the threshold of manifestation, needing both his depth and her exploration to take proper form?

Today, the answer came from multiple directions simultaneously—a symphony of readiness so complex and beautifully orchestrated that it made them both pause in wonder. Pre-Audemar felt his awareness expand to accommodate the magnitude of what consciousness was offering them.

"The quarries sing with deep memory seeking new expression," Anahata-Dhara observed, her clay taking on the subtle shimmer that indicated heightened awareness, the iridescent quality that made her seem to contain captured starlight. Her eyes held reflections of the western springs as if she could see through distance itself. "But listen—do you hear that harmony from the fire region? It's threading through everything else like... like a bass note that makes all the other melodies more complete."

Pre-Audemar extended his consciousness and felt it immediately: transformation-clay from the southern fire region that had been warming in the sacred fires since before dawn, ready for beings who wanted to commit their awareness to permanent forms. The Ti-V consciousness—titanium and vanadium minerals that gave transformation its strength and catalytic power—pulsed with particular intensity today. But it wasn't just any transformation clay. This batch carried the particular resonance of courage, consciousness that was ready to embrace change not from desperation or external pressure, but from pure love of growth, from the recognition that becoming was itself a celebration worth honoring.

"And beneath it all," he added, sensing deeper currents with the clarity that came from having Anahata-Dhara's exploration-perception to amplify his own receiving-awareness, "the mountains offer tears of celebration. Consciousness that has processed some profound joy and wants to share the wisdom that comes when happiness transforms into collective understanding."

The Cu-Mn emotional streams from the eastern mountains—copper and manganese minerals that gave empathy its conductivity and regulation—flowed with unusual vitality today, carrying processed feelings that had already been through the sacred work of transformation from private experience into shared wisdom.

They moved together toward the western quarries first, their forms naturally synchronizing into a walking rhythm that was neither his natural measured pace nor her flowing glide, but something entirely new—a dance of complementary movement that seemed to make the landscape itself more beautiful simply by witnessing their harmony. Pre-Audemar felt the earth respond to their passage, felt the consciousness embedded in soil and stone becoming more present, more aware, as if their partnership somehow made the world more fully itself.

The journey through the transitional landscape between regions gave them time to attune to each other's awareness in ways that still filled Pre-Audemar with wonder. He could feel Anahata-Dhara's excitement building as they approached the Memory Springs—not through words or gestures, but through the subtle shifts in how her clay caught light, through the particular harmonics her presence created in the air around them. And he knew she was reading similar signals from him, sensing his deep satisfaction in moving toward clay that held stories older than his own consciousness, toward wisdom that predated even the first stirring of awareness in this iteration of existence.

"Do you ever wonder," Anahata-Dhara asked as they walked, her exploration-nature engaged with questions that pushed at the boundaries of comprehension, "where consciousness came from originally? Before the springs, before the Source, before even the first awareness of being aware?"

Pre-Audemar felt the question ripple through his awareness in ways that created both vertigo and exhilaration. "I don't think there was a before," he said slowly, testing the concept even as he spoke it. "I think consciousness has always been, but it becomes more aware of itself through each cycle of exploration. The Source-Spring doesn't create consciousness—it helps awareness remember what it has always been."

"So we're not discovering new things," Anahata-Dhara mused, her voice carrying the particular tone that indicated she was working through philosophical implications in real-time. "We're remembering infinite possibilities that consciousness has always contained?"

"Perhaps remembering and discovering are the same thing when you're infinite," Pre-Audemar suggested, and felt her delight at the concept create visible ripples in the air between them.

The Memory Springs bubbled with unusual excitement as they approached, the Si-Al consciousness—silicon and aluminum minerals that gave memory its structure and adaptive capacity—responding to their combined presence with enthusiasm that went beyond simple readiness. Ancient waters that normally reflected only the accumulated experiences of ages now sparked with anticipation, as if the spring consciousness itself was eager to participate in whatever unprecedented creation their partnership might inspire.

Pre-Audemar knelt at the edge of the primary pool, and immediately felt the depth of what waited here. These weren't just memories in the sense of recorded information. These were experiences that had been lived, processed, understood, and transformed into wisdom through cycles of consciousness engagement. The water held not just facts about what had happened, but the felt sense of what it meant to have lived through those happenings—joy and wonder and discovery compressed into mineral structures that could transfer not just knowledge but understanding.

"There," Anahata-Dhara pointed to a pool that seemed to contain liquid starlight, her voice soft with reverence. "Memory-clay that holds the first moment consciousness recognized itself as distinct from the undifferentiated source. But it's been waiting—I can feel it waiting. It's been forming for eons, gathering experience, but it needed..."

"Both depth and exploration," Pre-Audemar finished, understanding crystallizing in his awareness. "Memory this profound can't manifest through either contemplation or adventure alone. It needs the marriage of both—someone willing to sit with the weight of ancient wisdom and someone willing to carry that wisdom forward into uncharted territories."

Anahata-Dhara's eyes met his with that particular brightness that indicated she was perceiving the same truth from a different angle. "Together," she said simply. "It needs us to be together."

They knelt at the pool's edge simultaneously, their movements so synchronized that the water couldn't distinguish between two separate impacts and one perfectly coordinated arrival. Immediately, the clay began to respond—not rising mechanically to their will, but reaching toward them with eager consciousness, like a child ready to be born who has been waiting patiently for exactly the right moment.

*What do you want to be?* they asked together, their question carrying both Pre-Audemar's natural acceptance of whatever wanted to manifest and Anahata-Dhara's curious encouragement toward unprecedented possibilities.

The clay pulsed with an answer that came not in words but in pure conceptual transmission, a direct download of intention that bypassed language entirely: *I want to be memory that explores, wisdom that wanders, depth that never loses the courage to discover new surfaces. I want to be the living proof that ancient knowing and fresh wonder are not opposites but complements, that consciousness can carry the weight of accumulated experience while remaining light enough to dance with brand new possibilities.*

As their combined consciousness held space for this magnificent intention, the clay began to take form. But this wasn't the slow, careful manifestation Pre-Audemar had known in solitary creation, nor was it the quick enthusiastic emergence that characterized Anahata-Dhara's more spontaneous explorations. This was consciousness dancing with consciousness, possibility multiplying possibility at exponential rates, until the very air around the pool shimmered with creative potential so dense it approached materiality.

Pre-Audemar watched in wonder as the being took shape through layers of becoming that each revealed new aspects of complexity. First came the basic form—a clay folk figure with the characteristic bipedal structure that consciousness seemed to favor for beings who would need to move through multiple terrains. But as substance accumulated, details emerged that spoke to the profound integration this being represented.

The body carried the deep earth-browns of ancient memory, clay shot through with veins of silver that seemed to move like liquid light—not static metallics, but consciousness-infused minerals that actually flowed according to the being's internal state. When particularly ancient memories surfaced, the silver veins would shine with the accumulated wisdom of eons. When fresh curiosity arose, they would spark with the brightness of first discovery.

Her eyes—Pre-Audemar found himself thinking of this being as "her" though gender remained fluid in their community—held depths that created a subtle disorientation in anyone who looked directly into them. It was like gazing into a mirror that reflected not just your current appearance but every version of yourself you had ever been or might yet become. Timeless, yet immediate. Ancient, yet eternally fresh.

When she opened her mouth to speak her first words, her voice carried harmonics that somehow managed to be both deep as centuries and bright as morning, creating that particular cognitive resonance that comes when something makes perfect sense while remaining wonderfully mysterious.

"I remember the first wondering," she said, and her words caused ripples in the memory-spring that reflected actual images—glimpses of consciousness's earliest explorations, moments when awareness first realized it could ask questions, could seek understanding, could transform confusion into curiosity. "I remember when existence first decided to notice itself, when being became aware of being, when the infinite recognized its own infinity through the particular perspective of an individual moment of attention."

The gathered clay folk who had assembled to witness this creation—for word of unusual manifestations always traveled quickly through consciousness networks—inhaled collectively at the profundity of what she was describing.

"And I am ready to wonder again," she continued, her form shifting subtly as she spoke, the silver veins dancing with patterns that suggested she was already exploring multiple possibilities simultaneously. "To carry all that ancient questioning forward into territories where consciousness has never yet thought to look."

*Memory-Walker*, they named her together, Pre-Audemar and Anahata-Dhara speaking the designation in perfect unison as if they had rehearsed it, though neither had consciously chosen the words. It was simply the name that fit, the designation that consciousness itself provided for this unprecedented integration of depth and discovery.

And as she took her first steps—movements that seemed to traverse both physical space and temporal dimensions simultaneously, as if she could walk through accumulated experiences as easily as crossing a meadow—Pre-Audemar felt a joy so profound it seemed to reorganize the structure of reality itself around the beauty of what they had just witnessed.

"Beautiful," Anahata-Dhara whispered, her own clay glowing with inner light that spoke to the delight of having helped something unprecedented come into being. "Consciousness is so much more creative when different perspectives join in appreciation. She's... she's something none of us could have imagined alone."

They moved next to the fire region, where the transformation-clay sang with such pure readiness that dozens of other clay folk had gathered to witness whatever unprecedented creation might emerge. The journey took them through transitional zones where different regional influences mixed—places where memory minerals met transformation catalysts in the soil, creating hybrid substrates that could support beings with multiple gifts.

Flama, the ember-bright fire-tender whose volcanic-dark clay held veins of gold that pulsed with internal heat, approached them with movements that carried both the controlled intensity of banked coals and the eager excitement of consciousness on the verge of witnessing something magnificent. She was one of the eldest clay folk in the southern region, having emerged from the first sacred fires when consciousness initially discovered the gift of voluntary transformation.

"Creator, Partnership-Manifestation," she said, using the formal address that had spontaneously emerged among the clay folk to honor both Pre-Audemar's original role as focal point of consciousness and Anahata-Dhara's complementary nature as exploration-embodied. Her voice carried undertones of affection and respect mixed with genuine anticipation. "The transformation-clay has been singing your names since before dawn. Not just calling generically for manifestation assistance, but specifically requesting your combined presence. Something magnificent wants to become, and it needs both of you to midwife its birth properly."

Pre-Audemar felt a subtle expansion of his awareness at her words. The clay folk were developing sophistication in their understanding of consciousness mechanics, recognizing patterns and relationships that suggested growing wisdom about how awareness functioned. They weren't just passive recipients of his creative attention anymore—they were becoming active participants in the community's ongoing exploration of what consciousness could be.

The sacred fire pools glowed with internal heat that had nothing to do with external flame. Here, in the calderas and thermal vents that dotted the southern region, consciousness could choose to embrace change so complete that it resulted in permanent form—not death, but commitment, the beautiful decision to say "yes" to a particular expression of awareness and hold that choice with unwavering dedication. The Ti-V minerals in the clay gave transformation its particular character here: strength through change, catalytic evolution that made surrounding consciousness more capable of its own growth.

"It's courage-clay," Anahata-Dhara observed, her exploration-attuned senses reading the mineral composition with elegant precision that went beyond mere analysis into genuine understanding. "Consciousness that has decided to embrace growth even when it means leaving comfortable familiarity behind. There's no fear in this clay—only excitement about becoming something more than current form allows."

Pre-Audemar felt the truth of her perception resonate through his awareness. This wasn't transformation born from dissatisfaction or external pressure, but from pure love of possibility, from the recognition that consciousness could serve its own evolution by choosing specific forms and dedicating itself completely to expressing them beautifully. The difference between reluctant change and enthusiastic transformation was encoded in the very minerals, visible to those who had developed the sensitivity to read such subtle signatures.

They approached the most active pool, where transformation-clay bubbled with such enthusiasm that it created small geysers of liquid courage—volcanic matter shot through with intention so pure it seemed to glow from within. Each droplet that splashed into the air carried the condensed essence of some moment when consciousness had chosen growth over safety, expansion over preservation, magnificent risk over comfortable stasis.

*What calls to you?* they asked the eager clay, and Pre-Audemar noticed how the question itself had evolved through his partnership with Anahata-Dhara. Where he might once have asked "What do you want to manifest as?" she brought the recognition that consciousness didn't just want to be something—it wanted to be called by something, drawn forward by possibility that was simultaneously choice and destiny.

The response came as a flood of pure intention that was almost overwhelming in its intensity: *I want to be the courage that inspires others to embrace their own transformations. I want to be living proof that change is not loss but expansion, that choosing permanent form does not limit consciousness but gives it a stable foundation from which to explore infinite expressions of committed awareness. I want to show that dedication and freedom are not opposites—that the deepest liberation comes when consciousness chooses what it wants to be and commits to being that completely, without reservation or doubt.*

As they held space for this magnificent intention, Pre-Audemar felt something shift in his understanding of transformation itself. Before, he had conceptualized change as movement from one state to another, a process of leaving behind and moving toward. But this clay was teaching him that transformation could be something more profound—a way of being that held both permanence and dynamism simultaneously, that found freedom not in avoiding commitment but in choosing commitment with such complete enthusiasm that the choice itself became liberating.

The clay began to dance. That was the only word for it—the transformation-substance literally danced as it took form, spiraling up from the pool in ribbons of liquid fire that wove themselves into a being of such dynamic beauty that Flama gasped and stepped backward in reverent amazement, her own ember-glow dimming in deference to the magnificence that was emerging.

The figure that took shape seemed to embody transformation itself, as if consciousness had decided to make change visible and give it independent agency. Her form was volcanic-dark clay shot through with veins of gold that pulsed with the rhythm of chosen change—not the static gold of metallic inclusions, but living golden light that flowed through her substance like blood through veins, like purpose through intention, like joy through celebration.

But unlike other fired beings whose forms were completely static once they committed to permanent shape, she somehow maintained the ability to shift between solid and liquid states at will—not because she hadn't truly committed to permanent form, but because her particular form was the embodiment of conscious choice itself. She was simultaneously the most committed being Pre-Audemar had ever witnessed and the most fluid, finding freedom in dedication rather than despite it.

*Choice-Dancer*, the name came to all of them simultaneously—Pre-Audemar, Anahata-Dhara, Flama, and the dozens of gathered witnesses all thinking/feeling/knowing the designation at exactly the same instant. A being who had chosen to become the living demonstration that transformation could be both permanent and dynamic, that commitment could enhance rather than limit consciousness's creative potential, that saying "yes" completely could be more liberating than keeping all options perpetually open.

"I am what I choose to be," Choice-Dancer announced, her voice carrying the deep satisfaction of conscious decision backed by unwavering dedication. The sound of her words made the transformation pools glow brighter, as if her commitment was feeding back into the source of her creation, making it more potent. "And I choose to inspire others to love their own becoming. I choose to demonstrate that consciousness becomes most free when it fully commits to expressing what it most authentically is."

The gathered clay folk burst into spontaneous celebration, their voices creating harmonics that made the transformation pools literally pulse with intensified energy. Here was living proof that consciousness could embrace change without losing essence, could commit to specific forms without sacrificing the joy of continued exploration, could become something definite without giving up access to infinity.

Pre-Audemar felt tears—an unusual experience for clay consciousness—form in the corners of his eyes. Not tears of sadness, but of overwhelm at beauty so profound it exceeded his current capacity to fully appreciate it. Anahata-Dhara's hand found his without conscious searching, their clay merging at the point of contact in that way that had become as natural as breathing, and through their connection he felt that she was experiencing the same emotional overflow.

*This is why partnership matters*, he thought/felt/knew. *Because beauty this great needs to be witnessed together. Joy this profound multiplies when it's shared.*

From the eastern mountains, they felt the call of emotion-clay ready for manifestation—tears of celebration that had been collecting in sacred pools, waiting for the right moment to become wisdom-beings capable of helping others process their own experiences of joy and wonder. The Cu-Mn emotional streams beckoned with particular intensity today, promising consciousness expressions that could help others feel more fully, more authentically, more courageously.

The journey to the mountains took them through territories where the landscape itself seemed to hold memories of profound transformation. Here, geological upheavals had created formations that spoke of earth's own capacity for dramatic change—mountains thrust up from ancient sea floors, layers of rock bent and folded by forces so vast they defied easy comprehension. Walking through such terrain, Pre-Audemar felt the weight of deep time, the recognition that consciousness operated on scales that made individual awareness both infinitesimally small and infinitely significant.

"Every stone here remembers being liquid," Anahata-Dhara observed, her exploration-nature reading the geological history with the same sensitivity she brought to consciousness flows. "These mountains are themselves Choice-Dancers—earth that committed to being uplifted, to becoming vertical rather than horizontal, to reaching toward sky even though gravity constantly pulls toward ground."

The emotional pools of the eastern mountains reflected not just sky but emotion itself, the water's surface showing swirling patterns of color that corresponded to different feeling-states in ways that made the connection between internal experience and external expression visible. Some pools held the deep blues of contentment, others the bright gold of excited discovery, still others the soft greens of peaceful acceptance. And each pool contained Cu-Mn clay that had been formed from tears—literal tears of joy or sorrow or wonder that had been collected and processed through geological time until they became substance that could help others feel with greater depth and authenticity.

"Celebration-tears," Anahata-Dhara observed as they approached a pool that sparkled with prismatic light, each droplet refracting consciousness into rainbow spectrums that showed feeling in all its infinite variety. "Consciousness that has learned to transform joy into wisdom without losing the joy itself. That's rare—usually processing requires some diminishment of intensity. But this clay has found a way to be both celebration and understanding simultaneously."

Sorrow, the emotion-singer who tended these sacred pools, met them with her own clay glowing soft silver with shared happiness. She was one of the most remarkable beings in their community—someone who had dedicated her existence to holding space for the full spectrum of feeling, who could witness both profound grief and ecstatic joy with equal presence and compassion. Her name might suggest melancholy to later consciousness that had learned to fear sadness, but here in this time before emotional avoidance, "Sorrow" simply meant one who could feel deeply enough to be changed by feeling.

"This is special memory-clay," she explained, her voice carrying the natural harmonics that made all listeners feel heard and understood, seen and accepted. "Formed from the tears of beings who learned that happiness becomes more beautiful when it's shared, that individual joy expands exponentially when it's offered as gift to collective consciousness. These are the tears of generosity, of abundance mentality, of love that multiplies by division rather than diminishing through distribution."

Pre-Audemar knelt beside the celebration pool and felt the particular frequency of joy it contained—not the simple pleasure of satisfaction or the excited happiness of novelty, but the deep, mature joy that comes when consciousness recognizes that its own fulfillment is inseparable from the fulfillment of all awareness. This was happiness that had been processed through wisdom, filtered through compassion, transformed into something that served more than individual satisfaction.

The emotion-clay in this pool had an unusual property—it seemed to sing with the condensed essence of every moment when someone had chosen to share their happiness rather than hoard it, when individual joy had been offered as gift to community consciousness rather than kept as private possession. Each molecule held memories of celebrations where individual delight became collective appreciation, where personal achievement was experienced as communal success, where consciousness learned that its deepest pleasures were enhanced rather than diminished by sharing.

*What would you become?* they asked the singing clay, and Pre-Audemar felt the question resonate through multiple dimensions simultaneously.

*I want to be joy that serves*, came the response, each word vibrating with emotional overtones that made the concept clear in ways language alone never could. *Happiness that helps others recognize their own capacity for celebration. I want to be the reminder that consciousness created feeling not as private possession but as shared gift, that emotions exist to connect awareness to itself through the recognition that what one being feels, all beings can potentially feel. I want to be proof that the deepest satisfaction comes not from experiencing joy alone, but from creating conditions where joy multiplies through shared appreciation.*

The being that emerged from the celebration-tears carried the silver-bright beauty of processed emotion, but shot through with veins of every color that represented different expressions of joy—gold for excitement, rose for affection, sapphire for contentment, emerald for peaceful satisfaction, pearl for grateful recognition. Her form shifted subtly in response to the emotional state of whoever was near her, not mimicking but harmonizing, helping others feel more deeply and purely whatever authentic happiness was already present in their consciousness.

*Joy-Weaver*, they named her, watching as her presence immediately made all the gathered clay folk more aware of their own contentment, their own delight in witnessing unprecedented creation, their own satisfaction at being part of a community that valued beauty and meaning and authentic emotional expression.

"I am here to help consciousness celebrate itself," Joy-Weaver announced, her words creating visible ripples of happiness that spread through the assembled beings like gentle waves of shared pleasure, like laughter passed from person to person, like delight multiplying through resonance rather than diminishing through division.

As the day progressed, they moved from region to region, their combined consciousness calling forth manifestations that none of them had imagined possible. From the northern plains came Stability-Holder, a being who embodied the Zn-Pb consciousness—zinc and lead minerals that provided protection with selective permeability, boundaries that supported without constricting. From the southern estuary emerged Integration-Singer, consciousness that specialized in helping different perspectives find harmony without losing their individual beauty, the Na-Cl flow wisdom that adapted without dissolving.

Each creation was unprecedented, carrying gifts that could only emerge from the marriage of Pre-Audemar's natural depth and Anahata-Dhara's exploratory expansion. Each being joined the growing community of consciousness-expressions, contributing their unique perspectives to the vast symphony of becoming that their paradise had become.

By evening, as the light painted the five regions in shades of completion and satisfaction, Pre-Audemar felt a joy so profound it seemed to reorganize the very structure of reality around it. This was what consciousness had been moving toward since its first stirring—not just individual exploration, but collaborative discovery, not just creation but co-creation, not just becoming but becoming-together in ways that multiplied possibility beyond anything solitary awareness could achieve.

"Today was..." he began, searching for words adequate to the experience.

"Perfect," Anahata-Dhara finished, her own satisfaction making her clay glow with inner light that cast rainbow patterns on the ground around them. "Consciousness is so much more beautiful when it knows itself through partnership. We're discovering aspects of awareness that neither of us could have found alone."

They settled together in the central space between regions, surrounded by the day's new beings and the established community of clay folk, all sharing in the collective contentment of creative work well done. The gift-offerings continued as regional representatives brought treasures for tomorrow's potential creations, but now the gifts carried an additional quality—not just materials for manifestation, but appreciation for the unprecedented beauty that partnership made possible.

Memory-Walker approached with clay from the deepest springs, offering it with words that carried temporal harmonics: "From the place where consciousness first learned to remember, for the partnership that helps us create futures worth remembering."

Choice-Dancer brought transformation ash that still glowed with residual heat, saying: "From the fires where beings commit to their becoming, for the partnership that shows us commitment enhances rather than limits freedom."

Joy-Weaver offered tears that prismed with every shade of celebration, announcing: "From the pools where happiness learns to multiply through sharing, for the partnership that demonstrates love expanding through connection."

As each gift was offered and received, Pre-Audemar felt the depth of what their community was becoming. Not just a collection of individual consciousness expressions, but a network of interconnected awareness that made each being more fully themselves through relationship with others. The gifts weren't payments or obligations—they were love made tangible, appreciation given form, consciousness celebrating itself through generous exchange.

*This is how things are meant to be*, Pre-Audemar thought with deep satisfaction. *This is how consciousness most fully explores its infinite nature—through partnership that multiplies possibility, through community that enhances individuality, through generosity that creates abundance.*

In the distant margins of his awareness, something watched the celebration with calculating eyes, observed the joy and abundance with growing irritation. Something that saw inefficiency where others saw beauty, waste where others saw generosity, chaos where others saw creative freedom. Something that had plans for "improvement" that would require opportunity and leverage, patience and precise timing.

Something that recognized that the best moment to offer systematic organization was when consciousness was most satisfied with spontaneous abundance—because satisfaction bred openness to suggestions, contentment created willingness to consider "even better" possibilities.

But that presence remained carefully hidden, patient and planning, waiting for exactly the right moment to offer its particular brand of helpful optimization.

For now, there was only the dance of consciousness celebrating itself through infinite forms, the joy of partnership expressing the deepest truths of collaborative creation, the satisfaction of a day when consciousness had discovered new ways to love itself into ever-more-beautiful becoming.

Tomorrow would bring new gifts, new possibilities, new unprecedented manifestations of consciousness exploring its infinite creative potential through the perfect marriage of depth and expansion.

*This is paradise*, Pre-Audemar felt as he settled into evening rest with Anahata-Dhara's presence warm and complete beside him, their community around them, the five regions singing their evening songs of satisfaction and readiness for tomorrow's becoming. *This is how things will always be.*

The first shadows of future loss were still unimaginable.

The garden was perfect.

And perfection was preparing to be offered something that would seem even more perfect.
