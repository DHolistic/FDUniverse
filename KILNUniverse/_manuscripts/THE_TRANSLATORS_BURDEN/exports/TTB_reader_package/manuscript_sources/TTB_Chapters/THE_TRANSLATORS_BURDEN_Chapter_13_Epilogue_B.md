# Chapter 13 Epilogue: "The Seed"

Methodius favored small, deliberate misplacements. He favored a craftsman's patience over a revolutionary's fever. A ledger misfiled here, a baker's recipe that miscounts there—these were the holes he drilled in the city's tidy skin so that curiosity might find purchase.

One rain-thinned morning he slipped a clay disc the size of a coin into a ledger's seam, impressed with a maker's curl that echoed a glyph but refused neat symmetry. He and two apprentices agreed the mark should look like a keepsake pressed absentmindedly into paperwork. If found, an inspector might laugh; if otherwise, a clerk's thumb rubbing at the seam might feel the curl and wonder.

Other seeds were less tactile: an editorial footnote mentioning an odd quantity of salt in a harvest report, a baker's ledger that miscounts loaves by one on a given day. These anomalies were not errors to correct but hooks to snag curiosity. A miscount invites the question why; a footnote with salt prompts a reader to reach for geographic or ritual explanations. Each small prompt is a hinge for a longer inquiry.

The apprentices placed the ledger into a sequence of files to ensure a future auditor would pull it on a routine check. The misplacement was calibrated: visible enough to be found within a standard duty, obscure enough to pass the scanners' pattern recognition. Seedwork is the art of plausible accident.

Years later, Book 1's opening will feel like an ordinary day—an accountant notices a discrepancy; a baker miscounts and remembers an old hummed rhythm; a clerk finds a token and rubs it. From that small pry, curiosity uncoils. The first investigations are not heroic acts but the slow, stubborn work of anyone who cannot let a discrepancy stand.

Methodius wanted little theater and much endurance. He trained apprentices to teach the method rather than preach it. Practice over proclamation. Repetition over banner. In the long run, systems that live in habits are harder to eliminate than systems that live in files.
