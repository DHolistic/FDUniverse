## üéØ **CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

### The Moral Framework
**Central Question:** *When truth becomes dangerous, who decides what knowledge should be preserved?*

A loyal Kiln scholar discovers the heretical consciousness tablets and must choose between:

- **Duty to Truth:** Preserve pre-Kiln wisdom for future generations  
- **Personal Safety:** Ignore the tablets and remain ignorant

### Visual Storytelling Approach
- **Split-panel technique:** Narrator's internal struggle vs. external compliance
- **Glyph integration:** Reader learns the writing system alongside the translator
- **Color progression:** Pages shift from Kiln-red to consciousness-blue as translator awakens
- **Mirror panels:** Show consequences of choices through parallel timelines
