  - Line 90: "Origins: Once Auren, Kiln warrior cast out for a single crack"

**Total "Auren" instances:** 14 occurrences across 2 files

### "Kaelen" Occurrences (Canonical - correct)
- **File:** THE KILN CODEX- STORY MASTER DOC V1.md
  - Line 791: "Before: Kaelen, perfect warrior broken and reassembled wrong"

**Total "Kaelen" instances:** 1 occurrence

### "Ruin" Usage (Nickname - correct)
Used correctly as nickname/informal reference to The Thrown Vessel in Book 5 manuscript and other contexts. This usage is intentional and should remain.

### "The Thrown Vessel" Usage (Primary Name - correct)
Used consistently across all documents as the character's primary post-transformation name. This usage is correct and should remain.

## Inconsistency Found

**Critical Issue:** The Story Master Doc contains both names:
- Most narrative sections use "Auren" (13 instances)
- One character summary uses "Kaelen" (1 instance)

This suggests the document was written at different times or the canonical name decision was made after most content was written.

## Recommendation

**Action Required:** Replace all 14 instances of "Auren" with "Kaelen" to establish consistency.

**Files to Update:**
1. `THE KILN CODEX- STORY MASTER DOC V1.md` - 13 replacements needed
2. `CompletingBook5Chat.md` - 1 replacement needed

## Name Evolution (Post-Standardization)

**Birth/Pre-transformation:** Kaelen  
**Current Primary Name:** The Thrown Vessel  
**Nickname (used by some characters):** Ruin  
**Non-canonical (being removed):** ~~Auren~~  

## Status
