## üîß Production Integration

### UV Ink Content Markers
While writing, mark content that should be UV ink visible:
- `[UV: TRY]` - The word "TRY" in specific story contexts
- `[UV: ‚ö°]` - Lightning/transformation symbol at key moments
- `[UV: )))` - Silence symbols during suppression scenes
- `[UV: hidden text]` - Text that should only appear under blacklight

### Symbol Integration
- **||||** (Memory symbol) - When memory/forgetting themes appear
- **))** (Silence symbol) - Moments of muting or containment
- **‚ö°** (Lightning/transformation) - Breakthrough or change moments
- **Other glyphs** as specified in production specifications

### Tactile Element Notes
Mark moments that could benefit from tactile book elements:
- Texture descriptions that mirror spine design
- Physical interaction moments between characters
- Environmental descriptions that could be embossed
