## Comparison Result

- [x] **IDENTICAL** - Files are byte-for-byte the same
- [ ] DIFFERENT - Files have different content

**Technical Verification:**
- ✅ File sizes match exactly (38,034 bytes)
- ✅ SHA256 hashes are identical 
- ✅ Content confirmed as markdown manuscript
- ✅ V2 was created 8 minutes after V1 (likely a copy with extension fix)

## Content Verification

Examined file content confirms this is a complete manuscript with:
- Chapter 1: "WET CLAY" 
- Chapter 2: "KILN'S WHISPER"
- 913 total lines
- Proper markdown formatting
- KILN universe narrative elements (The Unfired, Three Laws, etc.)

## Recommendation

**Since files are IDENTICAL:**
- **Keep:** V2 (KILN BK I - FIRST CRACK V2-dup...md) - already has correct .md extension
- **Archive:** V1 (KILN BK I - FIRST CRACK V1.ini) - wrong extension, redundant

**Proposed Actions:**
1. Rename V2: `KILN BK I - FIRST CRACK V2-dup...md` → `KILN_Book1_FirstCrack_V2.md`
2. Archive V1: Move `KILN BK I - FIRST CRACK V1.ini` to `_archive/old_versions/KILN_Book1_FirstCrack_V1_duplicate.md`

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Book 1 version mystery solved  
- Both files are identical copies
- V2 has correct extension and is newer
- Ready for Subagent 2 (File Extension Corrections)

**Next Action:** Proceed with standardized renaming and archival plan.
