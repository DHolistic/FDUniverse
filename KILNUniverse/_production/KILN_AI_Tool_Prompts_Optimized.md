## üñºÔ∏è DALL-E 3 Prompts (Key Frame Generation)

### Scene 1: Aude's First Refusal
```
A young woman with clay-textured skin refuses to enter an ancient ceremonial firing chamber. She stands defiantly as blue luminescent steam rises from her body, her skin glowing with flowing script-like patterns. The chamber behind her is built from geometric earth-toned stonework with red glowing glyphs carved into the walls. Cracked clay tiles spread beneath her feet. An imposing figure in ceramic armor with a cracking mask stands opposite her. The lighting creates dramatic tension between the rigid red glow of authority and the flowing blue light of consciousness. Cinematic composition, spiritual atmosphere, highly detailed.
```

### Scene 2: Ruin's Singing Cracks
```
A solitary figure stands in a broken clay disposal chamber surrounded by fractured pottery and ceramic debris. Golden light emanates from visible cracks across his chest and arms, creating beautiful geometric patterns. Rings of harmonic energy pulse through clay dust in the air around him. Ancient glyphs on nearby pottery begin to glow faintly in response to his presence. His posture transitions from shame to revelation. Warm golden lighting, spiritual resonance, dust particles catching light, highly detailed.
```

### Scene 3: Heretic Tablet Discovery
```
A woman kneels in a sacred underground chamber with natural clay walls. She discovers a glowing tablet buried beneath wet earth, ancient blue glyphs floating above its surface. Gentle steam rises from her body and interacts with the luminous script. The cavern breathes with elemental life - scrolls and map-like carvings cover the walls. Sacred geometry, underground lighting, mystical atmosphere, highly detailed.
```

### Scene 4: Enforcer's Doubt
```
A figure in perfect ceramic armor stands in the inner sanctum of a stronghold. The armor is geometrically precise except for a single visible crack. Red command glyphs flicker in the air around him while a soft blue glow begins to emerge from within the crack. His silhouette is framed by harsh architectural symmetry. The scene captures spiritual tension between rigid order and emerging identity. Cold ceremonial lighting with warm undertones, highly detailed.
```

### Scene 5: Consciousness Unbound
```
Two figures stand united on fractured ceramic ruins - a woman and a man with golden cracks. Blue and golden energy flows from their bodies into the surrounding clay landscape. Ancient red glyphs unravel in midair while the terrain shifts from geometric rigidity to flowing organic patterns. A third figure in armor kneels in realization behind them. This is a moment of elemental convergence and rebirth. Epic lighting, transformation scene, highly detailed.
