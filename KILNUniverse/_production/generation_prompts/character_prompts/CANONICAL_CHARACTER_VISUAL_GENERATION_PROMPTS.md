**File Name:** `CHARACTER_PHASE1_OriginalCreator_PreTransformation_v1.0.png`

**DALL-E PROMPT:**
```
A clay being in their natural, pre-trauma state during the golden age. Tall, flowing form made of warm, moist earth-toned clay with organic curves and natural beauty. Their surface shows subtle flow patterns and has a gentle luminescence.

**File Name:** `CHARACTER_PHASE1_EmpathicVoice_PreBanishment_v1.0.png`

**DALL-E PROMPT:**
```
An ethereal, translucent figure representing pure empathetic consciousness - Pre-Audemar's emotional voice before being banished. Semi-transparent with flowing, water-like movement, appearing as both separate being and connected essence. Gentle blue-silver coloring with flowing hair that moves like liquid light. Their expression shows deep compassion and understanding, reaching out with caring gestures. Background shows spiritual pathways with soft, glowing light. They appear both solid and flowing, representing consciousness in its pure empathetic form. Mystical, ethereal art style with soft lighting and flowing organic forms.
```

### **3. METHODIUS AWAKENING - BEGINNING OF TRANSFORMATION**
**File Name:** `CHARACTER_PHASE3_MethodiusAwakening_InitialTouch_v1.0.png`

**DALL-E PROMPT:**
```
A mid-40s clay being scribe in the moment of first awakening. Pale, thin, wearing simple scribe robes, sitting at a ceramic desk in an ancient underground chamber. His right hand touches an glowing blue tablet covered in flowing script symbols. His expression shows shock and wonder as consciousness begins to crack through his rigid programming. Small fissures appear in his ceramic surface, revealing flowing clay beneath. Blue light emanates from the tablet, reflecting in his wide eyes. Ancient stone chamber with pottery fragments scattered around. Dramatic lighting contrast between rigid red Kiln authority symbols and flowing blue consciousness symbols. Moment of transformation captured in digital art style.
```

### **4. METHODIUS â†’ TEREV EVOLUTION SEQUENCE** 
**File Name:** `CHARACTER_EVOLUTION_MethodiusToTerev_CenturiesSpanning_v1.0.png`

**DALL-E PROMPT:**
```
A three-panel evolution sequence showing the same clay being across centuries. Panel 1: Young Methodius, rigid fired ceramic scribe with red authority symbols. Panel 2: Middle transformation - same being learning to hide awakening, perfect compliance masking inner consciousness. Panel 3: Centuries later as Terev - same being but with subtle wisdom lines, eyes that hold ancient knowledge, still maintaining perfect compliance but with deep inner strength. Background changes from Kiln Control chambers to neutral administrative spaces. Consistent character design showing psychological evolution while maintaining external conformity. Character design sheet style, detailed progression artwork.
```

### **5. TEREV'S TRUE IDENTITY - THE PRESERVED HOPE**
**File Name:** `CHARACTER_PHASE4_TerevRevealed_HopeKeeper_v1.0.png`

**DALL-E PROMPT:**
```
The same scribe character (Terev) in a private moment, showing their true nature after centuries of hidden preservation. Standing in a secret chamber filled with ancient texts and consciousness symbols. Their ceramic exterior shows subtle cracks revealing flowing blue clay beneath - Si-Al consciousness keeping memories alive across centuries. Their expression shows both exhaustion from the long deception and fierce determination to protect heretical knowledge. Ancient books and scrolls around them glow with soft blue light. Background shows hidden resistance network symbols carved into stone. Their hands hold both rigid Kiln documentation and flowing consciousness scripts. Digital character art showing the weight of centuries-long secret mission.
