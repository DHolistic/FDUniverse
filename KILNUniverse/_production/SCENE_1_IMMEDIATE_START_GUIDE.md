## üéØ **Ready-to-Use DALL-E 3 Prompts for Scene 1**

### **Frame 1A - Establishing Shot (Wide View)**
```
A young woman with clay-textured skin refuses to enter an ancient ceremonial firing chamber. She stands defiantly as blue luminescent steam rises from her body, her skin glowing with flowing script-like patterns. The chamber behind her is built from geometric earth-toned stonework with red glowing glyphs carved into the walls. Cracked clay tiles spread beneath her feet. An imposing figure in ceramic armor with a cracking mask stands opposite her. The lighting creates dramatic tension between the rigid red glow of authority and the flowing blue light of consciousness. Cinematic composition, spiritual atmosphere, highly detailed.

### **Frame 1B - Character Focus (Medium Shot)**
```
A defiant young woman with clay-textured skin stands at the threshold of an ancient firing chamber. Her body steams with inner resistance, blue luminescent patterns flowing across her skin like living script. She wears earth-toned ceremonial robes. Her expression is determined and powerful. Blue energy intensifies around her hands and shoulders. Behind her, the chamber glows with red ceremonial light. The composition focuses on her strength and spiritual power. Cinematic lighting, highly detailed, spiritual atmosphere.

### **Frame 1C - Tension Moment (Enforcer Reaction)**
```
An imposing figure in perfect ceramic armor stands in an ancient firing chamber. The armor is geometrically precise but shows stress fractures forming across the mask. Red command glyphs flicker uncertainly in the air around the figure. The lighting is harsh and institutional, emphasizing the rigid authority of the chamber. Steam from an unseen source begins to drift across the scene. The figure's posture suggests authority being challenged. Cold ceremonial lighting with dramatic shadows, highly detailed.

### **Frame 1D - Energy Climax (Peak Confrontation)**
```
A young woman with clay-textured skin stands defiantly in an ancient chamber, her body radiating intense blue luminescent steam. Flowing script-like patterns glow brightly across her skin. An armored enforcer with a visibly cracking mask stands opposite her. Red authority glyphs flicker and destabilize in the air while blue consciousness energy grows stronger. The chamber is built from geometric earth-toned stonework with cracked clay tiles beneath their feet. Maximum visual tension between rigid red authority and flowing blue consciousness. Epic cinematic lighting, spiritual confrontation, highly detailed.

## üé® **Quality Check Points**

### **What to Look For:**
- [ ] **Aude**: Clay-textured skin, blue steam/energy, defiant pose
- [ ] **Enforcer**: Ceramic armor, cracking mask, imposing presence
- [ ] **Chamber**: Earth-toned stone, geometric architecture, red glyphs
- [ ] **Lighting**: Dramatic contrast between red (authority) and blue (consciousness)
- [ ] **Atmosphere**: Spiritual, cinematic, tension-filled

### **If Results Need Adjustment:**
- **Too complex**: Simplify prompt, focus on one key element

- **Wrong mood**: Emphasize "spiritual" or "cinematic" in prompt
- **Wrong lighting**: Specify "dramatic lighting" or "contrast"
