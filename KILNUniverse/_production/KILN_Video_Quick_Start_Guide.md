- **Alternative**: Midjourney + Pika Labs

### **STEP 2: Assemble Video (1 day)**
**Follow the post-production workflow:**
- Import assets into video editor
- Arrange according to storyboard timing
- Add transitions and effects
- Basic color correction

### **STEP 3: Polish & Export (0.5 day)**
**Final touches:**
- Audio design and music

## üéØ **Fastest Path to Results:**

### **Option A: Full AI Generation**
1. Use **all your existing prompts** in DALL-E 3/Midjourney
2. Generate motion with **Runway ML** or **Pika Labs**
3. Edit in **CapCut** (free, simple) or **DaVinci Resolve** (professional)

### **Option B: Hybrid Approach**
1. Generate **key scenes only** (Scene 1, 3, 5)
2. Create **simple transitions** between them
3. Focus on **encrypted messages** as connecting elements

### **Option C: Proof of Concept**
1. Create **one complete scene** (Scene 5 - Convergence)
2. Test your workflow and tools
3. Expand to full video once perfected
