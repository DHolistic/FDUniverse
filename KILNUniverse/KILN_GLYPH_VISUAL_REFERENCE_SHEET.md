## üî§ AI ART GENERATION PROMPTS

### FOR COMPLETE GLYPH SETS:
**Prompt:** "Create a complete set of mystical consciousness symbols. Include flowing organic shapes (waves, circles, crescents) representing natural awareness, and geometric shapes (triangles, squares, precise angles) representing authority and control. Style should be clean, symbolic, suitable for sacred text illustrations. Two distinct visual languages - one organic/flowing, one geometric/rigid."

### FOR SACRED TEXT PAGES:
**Prompt:** "Design a sacred text page with [specific glyphs] in [color scheme]. Include mystical symbols arranged in contemplative layout. Style: [flowing/protective/authoritarian/liberating/integrated] based on sacred text position. Background should be [pure blue/blue with amber borders/black with red accents/blue breaking through gold/blue with golden threads]."

### FOR CHARACTER REFERENCE:
**Prompt:** "Character consulting mystical glyph symbols. Character is [reading/interpreting/practicing] the glyphs with [natural flow/protective caution/rigid compliance/courageous defiance/integrated wisdom]. Scene should show relationship between character and sacred symbols."
